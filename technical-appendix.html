      <h2>1. Introduction and purpose of the STEPS tool</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        The STEPS FETP Scale Up Decision Aid is an interactive tool that combines information on preferences, costs and outbreak impacts to support decisions on scaling up Field Epidemiology Training Programmes (FETP) in India.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tool links three pieces of evidence. First, it uses a discrete choice experiment and mixed logit model to quantify how key stakeholder groups value alternative FETP programme designs. Second, it applies harmonised cost templates for frontline, intermediate and advanced tiers to translate a chosen monthly cost per trainee into a full economic cost per cohort. Third, it maps training outputs into expected outbreak responses and indicative monetary benefits using assumptions about completion rates, outbreaks handled per graduate per year, response time and the economic value of a major outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users configure scenarios by choosing programme attributes (tier, qualification, mentoring, delivery and response time), a monthly cost per trainee, cohort size, number of cohorts and whether the opportunity cost of trainee time is counted. The tool then reports endorsement probabilities, willingness to pay, epidemiological outputs, benefit cost ratios and net benefits. All results are designed for strategic planning and sensitivity analysis rather than for forecasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        This technical appendix explains how the STEPS calculations work. It is written for analysts who need to understand, reproduce and explain results to ministries of health and finance, development partners and FETP network stakeholders.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-2">
      <h2>2. Overview of the preference study and mixed logit model</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Discrete choice experiment</h3>
      <p>
        Preferences for FETP scale up options were elicited using a discrete choice experiment. In each choice task, respondents compared two hypothetical FETP programme options to an opt out alternative where no additional FETP training is funded. Programme options differed along several design attributes chosen through expert consultation and piloting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The attributes and levels used in the STEPS tool are:
      </p>
      <div class="grid-two">
        <div>
          <p><span class="tag">Tier of training</span> Frontline, Intermediate, Advanced.</p>
          <p><span class="tag">Mentoring intensity</span> Low, Medium, High.</p>
          <p><span class="tag">Delivery mode</span> Blended (online and in person), Fully in person, Fully online.</p>
        </div>
        <div>

          <p><span class="tag">Outbreak response time</span> Detect and respond within 30, 15 or 7 days for priority outbreaks.</p>
          <p><span class="tag">Monthly cost per trainee</span> Several levels in Indian Rupees, selected to support estimation of willingness to pay.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>2.2 Mixed logit model used in STEPS</h3>
      <p>
        The DCE data were analysed using a mixed logit model that allows preferences to vary across respondents. For the STEPS decision aid, the mean estimates from this mixed logit model are used as fixed coefficients to generate utilities, predicted endorsement and willingness to pay for any specified scenario.
      </p>

      <p>
        The programme option utility is coded as a linear index. For a given scenario, the utility for the programme option can be written informally as:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 1: Programme utility for a configuration</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
U_prog = β_ascProg
       + β_tier(intermediate)·I(intermediate)
       + β_tier(advanced)·I(advanced)
       + β_career(uni)·I(university qualification)
       + β_career(careerPath)·I(career pathway)
       + β_ment(medium)·I(medium mentoring)
       + β_ment(high)·I(high mentoring)
       + β_del(inperson)·I(fully in person)
       + β_del(online)·I(fully online)
       + β_resp(15)·I(15 days)
       + β_resp(7)·I(7 days)
       + β_cost · (monthly cost per trainee / 1000).
        </div>
        <div class="equation-explanation">
          Here I(·) is an indicator that equals 1 when the corresponding attribute level is present and 0 otherwise. Cost enters the utility in thousands of rupees per trainee per month to keep coefficients on a practical scale.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The opt out option has its own constant term and no attributes:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 2: Opt out utility</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
U_opt = β_ascOptOut.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The STEPS tool then converts utilities into endorsement and opt out probabilities using a two option logit formula. To maintain numerical stability, the tool subtracts the maximum utility before exponentiating:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 3: Endorsement and opt out probabilities</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
P(endorse) = exp(U_prog − maxU) / [exp(U_prog − maxU) + exp(U_opt − maxU)]
P(opt out) = 1 − P(endorse),
        </div>
        <div class="equation-explanation">
          where maxU is the larger of U_prog and U_opt. The endorsement rate in the tool is P(endorse) expressed as a percentage.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="section-3">
      <h2>3. Programme design attributes and fixed response time logic</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Programme design attributes in the configuration tab line up directly with coefficients in the mixed logit model and with cost and epidemiological calculations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user selects the programme tier (frontline, intermediate or advanced), career incentive, mentoring intensity and delivery mode. These choices determine which coefficients enter the utility function and which cost template and duration are used. The tool assumes a fixed response time of 7 days, which reflects stakeholders’ strong preference for rapid detection and response and simplifies interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the current version of STEPS, the response time selector is locked to the 7 day option. The tool enforces this by setting the response attribute to 7 days internally and disabling the 15 and 30 day options. The epidemiological module then uses the 7 day response time to apply a response time multiplier to outbreak responses (1.5 for 7 days, compared with 1.0 for 30 days).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-4">
      <h2>4. Cost construction methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The tool implements harmonised cost templates for each tier of FETP. For each tier, a combined template describes the percentage share of different cost components in the total direct programme cost. These templates are based on programme budgets and cost data from India and international FETP guidance, standardised for use across frontline, intermediate and advanced tiers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users specify the cost per trainee per month. The tool then multiplies this by the programme duration (in months) and the number of trainees per cohort to obtain the direct programme cost per cohort. The cost templates translate this overall programme cost into component breakdowns, but the total remains anchored on the user selected monthly cost per trainee.
      </p>

      <p>
        On top of direct programme costs, the tool allows for the inclusion of the opportunity cost of trainee time. Opportunity cost represents the value of trainee salary time while they are in training rather than performing their usual duties. It is implemented as a tier specific percentage markup applied to the direct programme cost per cohort.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-5">
      <h2>5. Cost component shares and scaling logic</h2>
      <p>
        For each tier, the combined cost template specifies identifiable components (such as core staff salaries, travel, training materials and rent) and their share in total direct programme cost. For example, the frontline template includes staff costs, workshops and in country travel, while the advanced template also includes trainee allowances, equipment and international travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the direct programme cost per cohort is denoted C_prog, and a particular component has a share s_k, then the monetary amount for that component is s_k × C_prog. The tool uses these shares to derive:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 4: Cost component level</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
Component_k amount per cohort = s_k × programme cost per cohort.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The costing tab shows each component’s share, the implied rupee amount per cohort and a per trainee per month figure. The latter is obtained by dividing the component amount by the product of trainees per cohort and programme duration in months. This makes it possible to compare component intensities across tiers and scenarios.
      </p>

    <section id="section-6">
      <h2>6. Programme cost per trainee and cohort calculations</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Programme costs in STEPS are driven by the user selected monthly cost per trainee and the assumed programme duration and cohort size.
      </p>

      <p>
        For any configuration, the tool calculates direct programme cost per cohort as:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 5: Programme cost per cohort</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
C_prog = (cost per trainee per month) × (programme duration in months) × (trainees per cohort).
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Programme durations used in the tool are:
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>Frontline: 3 months</li>
        <li>Intermediate: 12 months</li>
        <li>Advanced: 24 months</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Users can change the cost per trainee per month and the cohort size for each scenario. The tool responds in real time and updates results, charts and component breakdowns. All costs are reported in Indian Rupees, with an optional conversion to US dollars using the exchange rate set in the settings tab.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-7">
      <h2>7. Opportunity cost inclusion and exclusion logic</h2>
      <p>
        The opportunity cost switch in the configuration tab controls whether the value of trainee time is added to programme costs to form an economic cost concept. When the switch is on, the tool multiplies the direct programme cost per cohort by a tier specific opportunity cost rate and adds this to the programme cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a given tier with opportunity cost rate r_opp and programme cost per cohort C_prog, the calculations are:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 6: Opportunity cost and economic cost</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
Opportunity cost per cohort = r_opp × C_prog
Total economic cost per cohort = C_prog + opportunity cost per cohort.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The opportunity cost rates used in the tool (which can be updated in future releases if new evidence becomes available) are:
      </p>
      <ul class="small">
        <li>Frontline: 1.09</li>
        <li>Intermediate: 0.35</li>
        <li>Advanced: 0.30</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When the opportunity cost switch is off, the total economic cost per cohort is set equal to the direct programme cost per cohort and the opportunity cost component is zero.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-8">
      <h2>8. Willingness to pay calculations</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Willingness to pay (WTP) indicators in STEPS translate the preference model into rupee values that summarise stakeholders’ stated support for a programme configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tool first separates the non cost part of the programme utility from the cost term. Denoting the non cost utility as U_nonCost and the cost coefficient as β_cost (which is negative), willingness to pay per trainee per month in rupees is calculated as:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 7: WTP per trainee per month</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
WTP per trainee per month (INR)
  = (U_nonCost / |β_cost|) × 1000.
        </div>
        <div class="equation-explanation">
          The factor of 1000 is included because the cost variable in the model is expressed in thousands of rupees per trainee per month.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        WTP per cohort is then obtained by multiplying WTP per trainee per month by the number of months in the programme and the number of trainees per cohort:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 8: WTP per cohort and all cohorts</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
WTP per cohort (INR) = WTP per trainee per month × programme duration in months × trainees per cohort
Total WTP all cohorts (INR) = WTP per cohort × number of cohorts.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        A positive WTP per trainee per month indicates that, under the mixed logit model, respondents are willing to pay more per trainee per month for the configuration than for the baseline. A negative WTP implies that, at the current cost and attribute levels, respondents on average would need compensation to accept the programme relative to the reference. The tool reports WTP values without truncation and users should interpret them alongside endorsement rates and cost figures.
      </p>

    <section id="section-9">
      <h2>9. Epidemiological benefit construction</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Epidemiological outputs calculate how many graduates emerge from a configuration, how many outbreaks they respond to and the monetary value of those outbreak responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        The epidemiological module uses three sets of inputs: general settings, tier specific settings and the scenario’s endorsement rate. General settings include the planning horizon (in years), the discount rate for benefits and the value per outbreak. Tier specific settings include the completion rate, the number of outbreaks handled per graduate per year and the value per graduate. In the current version, the value per graduate is set to zero so that the monetary benefits are driven purely by outbreak responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a single cohort and a given tier, the expected number of effective graduates is:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 9: Graduates per cohort and all cohorts</div>
        <div class="equation-text">
Graduates per cohort
  = (trainees per cohort) × (completion rate) × (endorsement rate / 100)

Graduates all cohorts
  = graduates per cohort × number of cohorts.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Outbreak responses per year are obtained by multiplying effective graduates by the assumed number of outbreaks handled per graduate per year and a response time multiplier. The current multipliers in the tool are 1.0 for 30 days, 1.2 for 15 days and 1.5 for 7 days. In the current interface, response time is fixed at 7 days, so the multiplier is 1.5.
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 10: Outbreak responses and outbreak benefits</div>

  = graduates per cohort × outbreaks per graduate per year × response time multiplier

Annual outbreak benefit per cohort (INR)
  = outbreak responses per year per cohort × value per outbreak.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        To convert annual outbreak benefits into an indicative present value over the planning horizon, the tool applies a standard annuity formula. For a planning horizon T years and a discount rate r, the present value factor is:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 11: Present value factor and outbreak benefit per cohort</div>

Outbreak related epidemiological benefit per cohort (INR)
  = annual outbreak benefit per cohort × PV factor.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the default settings, the planning horizon is 5 years and the discount rate is 3 percent per year. Graduate benefits are set to zero in the current version, so the epidemiological benefit per cohort equals the discounted outbreak benefit per cohort.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-10">
      <h2>10. Value per outbreak calibration and sensitivity ranges</h2>
      <p>
        The value per outbreak is meant to capture the economic cost of a major outbreak that can be at least partly prevented or mitigated by trained field epidemiologists. The default value used in the tool is ₹4 million per outbreak, based on a synthesis of evidence on health sector costs, productivity losses and disruption for moderate size outbreaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because there is uncertainty around this value, the tool includes built in “value per outbreak” presets and sensitivity controls. Users can type a value directly (for example “4,000,000”, “4 million” or “4 crore”) or choose from pre set values such as ₹4 million, ₹5 million, ₹10 million, ₹20 million, ₹30 million and ₹40 million. The tool normalises these inputs and converts them into a value in rupees per outbreak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the value per outbreak is updated, the tool applies it to all tiers and recalculates outbreak related benefits, benefit cost ratios and net benefits. Settings changes are recorded in a log panel so that users can track which values were used when interpreting results.

    <section id="section-11">
      <h2>11. Benefit cost ratios and net benefit</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        STEPS uses economic costs and outbreak related epidemiological benefits to construct benefit cost ratios (BCRs) and net benefits at cohort and national level.
      </p>

      <p>
        At cohort level, the benefit cost ratio is defined as:
      </p>

      <div class="equation-block">
        <div class="equation-label">Equation 12: Benefit cost ratio and net benefit per cohort</div>
        <div class="equation-text">

Net benefit per cohort (INR)
  = epidemiological benefit per cohort − total economic cost per cohort.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Values above one for the BCR indicate that, under the current assumptions about outbreak value, discounting and completion rates, the outbreak related benefits exceed the economic costs. Positive net benefits indicate a similar conclusion, expressed as a rupee amount instead of a ratio.
      </p>

      <p>
        At national level, the tool multiplies both outbreak benefits and economic costs per cohort by the number of cohorts. It then reports:

      <h2>12. National simulation scaling</h2>
      <p>
        The national simulation tab in STEPS takes the results for a single configuration and scales them across all planned cohorts. It reports total graduates, outbreak responses per year and total economic costs and benefits across all cohorts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Graduates all cohorts are calculated by multiplying the graduates per cohort by the number of cohorts. Outbreak responses per year at national scale are calculated by multiplying the per cohort outbreak responses by the number of cohorts. Economic costs and outbreak benefits per cohort are also multiplied by the number of cohorts to obtain the total economic cost and total outbreak benefit for the configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The national summary text provides an interpretation of these numbers, focusing on how many graduates are generated, how many outbreaks per year they respond to in total, what the approximate total economic cost is and how large the outbreak related benefit and national BCR appear under current assumptions.

      <h2>13. Sensitivity analysis framework (WTP and outbreak benefits)</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        The sensitivity tab combines willingness to pay and outbreak related benefits to explore how robust the business case is under different assumptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tool constructs a sensitivity summary table for the current configuration and any saved scenarios. For each scenario it computes:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>Total economic cost all cohorts.</li>
        <li>Total epidemiological outbreak benefit all cohorts.</li>
        <li>Net epidemiological benefit all cohorts (outbreak benefit minus cost).</li>
        <li>Total WTP all cohorts from the preference model.</li>
        <li>A simple “outbreak related” component of WTP, set to 30 percent of total WTP all cohorts.</li>
        <li>Combined benefits that add total WTP and epidemiological benefits when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Benefit cost ratios and net present values for WTP only and for combined benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Users can choose between different benefit definitions. In “WTP only” mode, benefits consist only of the WTP outputs from the preference model. In “endorsement adjusted” mode, WTP is scaled by the endorsement rate (or by an endorsement percentage specified by the user) so that configurations with low endorsement contribute less to effective WTP benefits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users can also switch outbreak benefits on or off in the sensitivity summary. When outbreak benefits are switched off, the combined benefit concept collapses to WTP only and the epidemiological benefit columns show “not included”. When outbreak benefits are switched on, combined benefits include both WTP and outbreak related benefits.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each configuration, the tool reports benefit cost ratios and net benefits for up to two benefit definitions:

      <h2>14. Worked examples for scenarios S1–S7</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        This section summarises the main outputs for seven illustrative configurations (S1–S7) using the formulas described above. These examples are intended to show how endorsement, costs, epidemiological benefits and benefit cost ratios interact for different programme designs.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S1: Frontline, low mentoring, blended delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Frontline tier, government certificate, low mentoring, blended delivery, response time fixed at 7 days, cost per trainee per month set to ₹40,000, 30 trainees per cohort and 3 cohorts with opportunity cost included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under these settings the endorsement rate is around 76 percent. The programme cost per cohort is about ₹3.6 million, and the inclusion of opportunity cost increases the total economic cost per cohort to around ₹7.5 million. With the default epidemiological assumptions (90 percent completion, 0.5 outbreaks per graduate per year, 7 day response multiplier of 1.5, value per outbreak ₹4 million, planning horizon 5 years and discount rate 3 percent) the configuration generates about 21 effective graduates per cohort and around 15–16 outbreak responses per year per cohort. The discounted outbreak related benefit per cohort is approximately ₹280 million and the benefit cost ratio per cohort is around 38, implying a very strong case on outbreak benefits alone. Total economic cost across three cohorts is about ₹23 million and total outbreak related benefits are approximately ₹840 million, giving a national benefit cost ratio similar to the per cohort figure.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S2: Frontline, high mentoring, blended delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S2 is identical to S1, except that mentoring intensity is increased from low to high while the cost per trainee per month remains ₹40,000. This raises the non cost utility and therefore endorsement and willingness to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        In S2 the endorsement rate rises to around 86 percent and the implied willingness to pay per trainee per month increases sharply. Costs and epidemiological assumptions are unchanged, so programme cost per cohort and total economic cost per cohort remain at about ₹3.6 million and ₹7.5 million respectively. Effective graduates per cohort increase and outbreak responses per year per cohort rise to roughly 17–18. The outbreak related benefit per cohort increases to just over ₹300 million and the benefit cost ratio reaches the low 40s. This example illustrates how strengthening mentoring, without changing cost, can shift endorsement and epidemiological benefits upwards.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S3: Frontline, low mentoring, fully online delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S3 shares the same cost, tier, career incentive and cohort structure as S1 but changes the delivery mode from blended to fully online. In the preference model, fully online delivery has a negative coefficient, reflecting lower support compared with blended or fully in person delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result the endorsement rate falls to just above 50 percent and the implied willingness to pay per trainee per month becomes negative at this cost level. Programme and economic costs per cohort remain similar to S1, and epidemiological benefits are still sizeable because the model assumes that effective graduates who support an online programme can still respond to outbreaks. Under the default outbreak value the benefit cost ratio for S3 remains well above 1. However, the combination of lower endorsement and negative WTP signals that such a configuration may face resistance from stakeholders even though the outbreak benefit assumptions continue to generate high ratios on paper.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S4: Intermediate tier, medium mentoring, blended delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S4 moves to the intermediate tier with medium mentoring and blended delivery, a cost per trainee per month of ₹60,000, 40 trainees per cohort and 4 cohorts. Programme duration is now 12 months. Opportunity cost is included using the intermediate tier rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under these settings the endorsement rate is around 85 percent and the implied willingness to pay per trainee per month is roughly ₹290,000. Programme cost per cohort is about ₹28.8 million and total economic cost per cohort is about ₹38.9 million after adding opportunity cost. With the default epidemiological assumptions the configuration generates around 31 effective graduates per cohort and approximately 23 outbreak responses per year per cohort. The discounted outbreak related benefit per cohort is roughly ₹420 million, which yields a benefit cost ratio of around 11. At national scale, four cohorts cost about ₹156 million and generate about ₹1.7 billion in outbreak related benefits, resulting in a benefit cost ratio similar to the per cohort figure.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S5: Advanced tier, high mentoring, in person delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S5 considers an advanced tier programme with university qualification, high mentoring and fully in person delivery. The cost per trainee per month is set at ₹80,000, with 25 trainees per cohort, 2 cohorts, a 24 month duration and opportunity cost included using the advanced tier rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Endorsement for S5 is around 87 percent and the implied willingness to pay per trainee per month is close to ₹340,000. Programme cost per cohort is about ₹48 million and total economic cost per cohort is around ₹62.4 million. The configuration produces roughly 20 effective graduates per cohort and about 15 outbreak responses per year per cohort. This translates into a discounted outbreak related benefit per cohort of about ₹270 million and a benefit cost ratio a little above 4. At national level, two cohorts cost about ₹125 million and produce about ₹530 million in outbreak benefits, leading to a similar BCR and a substantial positive net benefit.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S6: Frontline, high mentoring, career pathway incentive, lower cost</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S6 returns to the frontline tier but with high mentoring, career pathway recognition, a lower cost per trainee per month of ₹25,000, 50 trainees per cohort and 5 cohorts. Programme duration is again 3 months and opportunity cost is included. This configuration reflects a relatively low cost but attractive frontline programme with larger cohorts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the slightly negative coefficient on the career pathway incentive, the combination of high mentoring and moderate cost results in an endorsement rate of about 86 percent and an implied willingness to pay per trainee per month of roughly ₹260,000. Programme cost per cohort is about ₹3.75 million and total economic cost per cohort is about ₹7.8 million. With the default epidemiological assumptions S6 produces close to 39 effective graduates per cohort and around 29 outbreak responses per year per cohort. Discounted outbreak benefits per cohort are on the order of ₹530 million, giving a benefit cost ratio well above 60. At national scale, five cohorts cost under ₹40 million and yield over ₹2.6 billion in outbreak related benefits under current assumptions.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenario S7: High cost, low mentoring, online delivery</h3>
      <p class="scenario-subtitle">Configuration</p>
      <p>
        Scenario S7 is a stress test. It specifies a frontline tier programme with career pathway incentive, low mentoring, fully online delivery and a high cost per trainee per month of ₹100,000. There are 20 trainees per cohort, 2 cohorts and opportunity cost is included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under these settings the endorsement rate falls to around 42 percent and the implied willingness to pay per trainee per month is negative, indicating that at this cost level respondents would generally prefer not to fund the programme compared with the baseline. Programme cost per cohort is about ₹6 million and total economic cost per cohort is about ₹12.5 million. Effective graduates per cohort fall to under 8 and outbreak responses per year per cohort are a little under 6, which still generates discounted outbreak benefits in the order of ₹100 million per cohort under the current outbreak value and discount assumptions. This corresponds to a benefit cost ratio above 8 and a positive net benefit per cohort. The scenario highlights how generous outbreak value assumptions can make a configuration look favourable on epidemiological benefit cost grounds even when endorsement is weak and WTP is negative.

      <h2>15. Copilot interpretation and JSON export</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        The Copilot tab helps users turn STEPS outputs into narrative policy briefs using Microsoft Copilot or similar generative AI tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a user presses the Copilot button, the tool constructs a text prompt that contains three elements. First, it includes a standard instruction block that tells Copilot to write a three to five page policy brief with sections on background, scenario description, preference evidence and endorsement, economic costs, epidemiological effects, benefit cost results, distributional and implementation considerations and recommendations. Second, it appends the full scenario JSON that summarises the configuration, preference model outputs, cost and epidemiological results and benefit cost ratios. Third, it wraps the JSON between clear start and end markers so that Copilot can parse the numbers reliably.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scenario JSON includes metadata such as the generation time, country and planning horizon, the full configuration (tier, career incentive, mentoring, delivery, response time, costs, cohort size and opportunity cost setting), the key preference outputs (endorsement rate, opt out rate, WTP per trainee per month, WTP per cohort and total WTP), cost results (programme cost, opportunity cost, economic cost per cohort and total economic cost across all cohorts), epidemiological results (graduates per cohort, total graduates, outbreak responses per year per cohort and national scale, and outbreak benefits) and benefit cost results (BCRs, net benefits and the outbreak related component of WTP).
      </p>

      <p>
        After the prompt is generated, the tool copies it to the user’s clipboard (where browser permissions allow) and opens Copilot in a new tab. Users paste the prompt into Copilot and request a policy brief. They can then further edit the draft in Copilot or in a word processor, using the underlying STEPS scenario JSON as a transparent record of the assumptions and figures used.

      <h2>16. Summary of assumptions and limitations</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        The STEPS FETP Scale Up Decision Aid is designed as a transparent, scenario based planning tool rather than a forecasting model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main assumptions used in the current version are that preference patterns in the DCE and mixed logit model are valid for the decision makers of interest, that cost templates and opportunity cost rates reflect realistic programme budgets, and that the value per outbreak and epidemiological parameters are reasonable for national scale planning in India. Outbreak values and epidemiological inputs are uncertain, so users are encouraged to explore a range of values and to focus on how results change when assumptions are varied.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tool treats benefit estimates as indicative economic values rather than as exact projections of costs saved. WTP outputs summarise stated preferences from the mixed logit model and should not be interpreted as budget commitments. Epidemiological benefits are based on outbreak equivalents and an assumed value per outbreak, not on detailed disease specific models. The benefit cost ratios and net benefits reported in STEPS should therefore be used to compare scenarios and to support structured discussions, rather than as definitive estimates of returns on investment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite these limitations, the STEPS tool provides a consistent framework that brings together preference evidence, costs and outbreak related benefits. The technical appendix documents the formulas used so that analysts can reproduce calculations, check assumptions and explain results clearly to decision makers.
