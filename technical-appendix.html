    <h2>Technical appendix: how the STEPS FETP India tool does the calculations</h2>
    <p>
      This appendix explains how the STEPS tool converts program scenarios into:
      predicted endorsement, willingness to pay (WTP), training costs, outbreak response benefits,
      present values and benefit cost ratios. All numbers and coefficients below match the
      current <code>script.js</code>.

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>1. Preference model used in the STEPS tool</h3>
    <p>
      The tool is built on a mixed logit discrete choice experiment. For the appendix we use the
      mean coefficients from that model. Utility is measured on a latent scale; only differences
      in utility matter for choices.
    </p>

    <h4>1.1 Attributes and coefficients</h4>
    <p>
      The utility of joining a STEPS program has:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a constant for choosing any STEPS program (<code>ascProgram = 0.168</code>)</li>
      <li>effects for each program attribute level</li>
      <li>a cost term for the monthly training cost per trainee</li>
    </ul>

      Positive coefficients make programs more attractive, negative coefficients make them less attractive.
      The cost coefficient means that increasing the monthly cost by 1&nbsp;000 rupees per trainee reduces
      utility by 0.005 units on the latent utility scale.

  <!-- 2. From attributes to utilities -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>2. From a scenario to utility</h3>
    <p>
      For any scenario, the tool:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Starts with the program constant <code>0.168</code>.</li>
      <li>Adds the coefficient for the chosen level of each attribute.</li>
      <li>Subtracts the cost effect, which is the monthly cost (in thousand rupees) multiplied by <code>0.005</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We call the sum of the constant and all non cost terms the
      <strong>non cost utility</strong> <code>U_non_cost</code>.
      The full utility for the STEPS program is:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>U_program = U_non_cost + (beta_cost × monthly_cost_in_thousand_rupees)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The opt out option has a fixed utility:
      <code>U_opt_out = -0.601</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 3. From utilities to endorsement -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>3. From utilities to predicted endorsement</h3>
    <p>
      The model uses a standard logit formula. Given the utility of the STEPS program
      <code>U_program</code> and the opt out utility <code>U_opt_out</code>,
      the probability that a representative stakeholder endorses the program is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>P(STEPS) = exp(U_program) / [exp(U_program) + exp(U_opt_out)]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability of not endorsing STEPS is <code>1 − P(STEPS)</code>.
      These probabilities drive the endorsement percentage shown in the configuration and results tabs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 4. From utilities to WTP -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>4. From utilities to willingness to pay</h3>
    <p>
      The cost coefficient tells us how utility changes when the monthly cost per trainee changes.
      We interpret this as a marginal rate of substitution between the program attributes and cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool first computes <code>U_non_cost</code> for a scenario. The implied
      willingness to pay per trainee per month is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        WTP_per_trainee_per_month
        = U_non_cost ÷ |beta_cost| × 1&nbsp;000
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <code>beta_cost = -0.005</code>, a non cost utility of 1.0 corresponds to
      <code>1 ÷ 0.005 = 200</code> thousand rupees per trainee per month, or
      200&nbsp;000 rupees.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain WTP per cohort, the tool multiplies this monthly WTP by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>program length in months</li>
      <li>number of trainees per cohort</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- 5. Cost and opportunity cost -->

  <div class="appendix-card">

      The cost side follows simple accounting rules, scaled to a cohort of trainees.
      Program lengths by tier are:

      For the worked examples below we assume a cohort size of 30 trainees. The direct training cost
      for one cohort is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Direct cost = monthly cost per trainee × program months × cohort size</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, trainees devote time that could have been spent on their usual duties.
      We treat this as an opportunity cost equal to a fixed proportion of the direct cost:

  <!-- 6. Outbreak response benefits -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>6. Outbreak response benefits and present value</h3>
    <p>
      The benefit side links trained epidemiologists to improved outbreak response and monetary value.
      The tool uses the following assumptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Completion rate: 90 percent of enrolled trainees complete the program.</li>
      <li>Each graduate contributes to 0.5 outbreaks managed per year on average.</li>
      <li>Responding within 7 days multiplies this impact by a factor of 1.5.</li>
      <li>The monetary value of managing one outbreak is 4 million rupees.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For a cohort with endorsement probability <code>P(STEPS)</code> and cohort size
      <code>N</code>, the expected number of effective graduates is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Effective graduates = N × 0.9 × P(STEPS)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      With a 7 day response capacity the expected outbreaks managed per year by this cohort are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Outbreaks per year = Effective graduates × 0.5 × 1.5</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The annual monetary benefit is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Annual benefit = Outbreaks per year × 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 rupees</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      To account for time, the tool converts this constant annual stream of benefits into a five year
      present value using a discount rate of 3 percent per year. The present value factor is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PV factor = (1 − (1 + r)<sup>−T</sup>) ÷ r</code> with <code>r = 0.03</code>
      and <code>T = 5</code>, which gives <code>PV factor = 4.579708</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present value of outbreak benefits for one cohort is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PV benefit per cohort = Annual benefit × 4.579708</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for one cohort is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>BCR = PV benefit per cohort ÷ Total economic cost per cohort</code>

      All seven scenarios have high predicted endorsement, between about 79 and 89 percent.
      Benefit cost ratios vary widely because program length and cost differ by tier.
      The advanced scenarios (S1 to S3) have benefit cost ratios between 2.8 and 4.6.
      Intermediate scenarios are more cost efficient, with ratios from 6.3 up to about 12.1.
      The short frontline scenario S7 has a very high ratio of about 21 because the costs are low
      while the predicted outbreak benefits remain large.

    <h3>8. Worked example: Scenario S5</h3>
    <p>
      Scenario S5 is an intermediate tier program with medium mentoring, blended delivery,
      a government and partner certificate, outbreak response within 7 days and a monthly
      cost of 75&nbsp;000 rupees per trainee. This section walks through the calculation
      step by step for a cohort of 30 trainees.

    <h4>8.1 Utility and endorsement</h4>
    <p>
      First we sum the non cost terms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Program constant: 0.168</li>
      <li>Intermediate tier: 0.220</li>
      <li>Medium mentoring: 0.453</li>
      <li>Blended delivery: 0.000</li>
      <li>Government and partner certificate: 0.000</li>
      <li>Response within 7 days: 0.610</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Adding these gives a non cost utility
      <code>U_non_cost = 0.168 + 0.220 + 0.453 + 0 + 0 + 0.610 = 1.451</code>.
      The monthly cost per trainee is 75 thousand rupees, so the cost term is
      <code>beta_cost × 75 = -0.005 × 75 = -0.375</code>.
      The full utility for the program is therefore
      <code>U_program = 1.451 − 0.375 = 1.076</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opt out utility is <code>-0.601</code>. The endorsement probability is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        P(STEPS) = exp(1.076) / [exp(1.076) + exp(-0.601)] = 0.8425
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      so about 84.3 percent of stakeholders are predicted to endorse this configuration.
    </p>

    <h4>8.2 WTP for S5</h4>
    <p>
      Using the non cost utility, the willingness to pay per trainee per month is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        WTP_per_trainee_per_month
        = 1.451 ÷ 0.005 × 1&nbsp;000
        = 290&nbsp;200 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      For an intermediate program of 12 months and a cohort of 30 trainees, the implied WTP per cohort is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        WTP_per_cohort
        = 290&nbsp;200 × 12 × 30
        = 104&nbsp;472&nbsp;000 rupees
      </code>
      which is about 104.472 million rupees.
    </p>

    <h4>8.3 Costs for S5</h4>
    <p>
      The direct training cost per cohort is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Direct cost
        = 75&nbsp;000 × 12 × 30
        = 27&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity cost for the intermediate tier is 35 percent of the direct cost:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Opportunity cost
        = 0.35 × 27&nbsp;000&nbsp;000
        = 9&nbsp;450&nbsp;000 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The total economic cost per cohort is therefore:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Total economic cost
        = 27&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 + 9&nbsp;450&nbsp;000
        = 36&nbsp;450&nbsp;000 rupees
      </code>
      which is 36.450 million rupees.
    </p>

    <h4>8.4 Outbreak benefits and present value for S5</h4>
    <p>
      With 30 trainees and a 90 percent completion rate, 27 trainees complete the program.
      Multiplying by the endorsement probability gives the expected number of effective graduates:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Effective graduates
        = 27 × 0.8425
        = 22.7477
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each graduate manages 0.5 outbreaks per year, and the 7 day response capacity multiplies
      this by 1.5. The expected outbreaks managed per year by the cohort are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Outbreaks per year
        = 22.7477 × 0.5 × 1.5
        = 17.0608
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      With a value of 4 million rupees per outbreak, the annual monetary benefit is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Annual benefit
        = 17.0608 × 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;000
        = 68&nbsp;243&nbsp;056.70 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Applying the five year present value factor of 4.579708 gives:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        PV benefit per cohort
        = 68&nbsp;243&nbsp;056.70 × 4.579708
        = 312&nbsp;533&nbsp;217.26 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is about 312.533 million rupees.
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefit cost ratio for S5 is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        BCR
        = 312&nbsp;533&nbsp;217.26 ÷ 36&nbsp;450&nbsp;000
        = 8.57
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The net present benefit is the difference between benefits and total cost:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        Net benefit
        = 312&nbsp;533&nbsp;217.26 − 36&nbsp;450&nbsp;000
        = 276&nbsp;083&nbsp;217.26 rupees
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      so the program delivers a large surplus of benefits over costs in this scenario.

  <!-- 9. How the tool uses these results -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>9. How these calculations feed into the STEPS tool</h3>
    <p>
      The main STEPS tabs read directly from these calculations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>Configuration</strong> tab shows the endorsement percentage and WTP
        based on the utilities in section 2 and 3.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Costs</strong> and <strong>Budget</strong> outputs use the direct and
        opportunity cost formulas in section 5 and scale them by the number of cohorts.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Impact</strong> and <strong>Economic benefits</strong> sections use the
        outbreak response and present value logic in section 6.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Sensitivity</strong> tab varies key parameters (cost, program tier,
        mentoring, number of cohorts and discount rate) and recomputes the same steps for each
        setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Copilot</strong> tab packages the scenario specific numbers
        (endorsement, WTP, costs and present value benefits) into a JSON prompt that can be
        pasted into a generative tool to create narrative policy briefs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- 10. Assumptions and limitations -->

  <div class="appendix-card">
    <h3>10. Key assumptions and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, it is important to remember the main assumptions behind these numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The preference parameters are estimated from a discrete choice experiment with a specific
        sample of stakeholders. Different samples could give slightly different coefficients.
      </li>
      <li>
        The outbreak impact assumptions (0.5 outbreaks per graduate per year, 1.5 multiplier for
        a 7 day response and 4 million rupees per outbreak) are based on expert judgement and
        literature, and can be adjusted in future versions of the tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Opportunity cost shares by tier are stylised and aim to reflect typical time commitments
        of trainees. They are not accounting data from a specific program budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        The present value factor is calculated for a constant benefit flow over five years with a
        fixed discount rate of 3 percent. A different horizon or rate would change the benefit
        numbers but not the underlying logic.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users can therefore treat the values in this appendix as transparent worked examples that
      can be updated if better evidence on costs or epidemiological impacts becomes available.
