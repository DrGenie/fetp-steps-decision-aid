OVERVIEW --> <section id="sec-overview" class="appendix-section"> <h2>1. Overview and main concepts</h2> <p> STEPS is a decision aid that helps national and state partners in India explore alternative designs and scale up options for Field Epidemiology Training Programmes. The tool allows users to define training configurations, such as tier, mentorship and delivery mode, and to see in real time how these choices affect stakeholder endorsement, programme costs, epidemiological benefits and overall cost benefit metrics. </p> <p> The tool relies on three sets of inputs. First, it uses a discrete choice experiment with health system stakeholders that asked respondents to choose between alternative FETP configurations and an explicit opt out option. Second, it uses cost templates drawn from World Health Organization guidance, national costing exercises and partner institutions in India for different FETP tiers and delivery models. Third, it uses epidemiological and health security assumptions that link additional graduates and improved outbreak response capacity to indicative monetary benefits. </p> <p> At each step the interface displays simple numbers such as endorsement percentages, costs per cohort, graduates, outbreak responses and benefit cost ratios. Behind these numbers sit assumptions and formulas. This appendix explains each assumption, cites the sources used where possible and shows how users can change key assumptions in the Advanced settings tab as better information becomes available. </p> <div class="summary-callout"> STEPS is deliberately transparent. Every slider and toggle correspond to parameters that can be discussed, challenged and updated. The tool is not a black box epidemiological model but a structured way of combining preference data, cost data and simple epidemiological multipliers in support of investment and planning discussions. </div> </section> <!-- 2. TAB BY TAB --> <section id="sec-tabs" class="appendix-section"> <h2>2. Tab by tab explanation</h2>
<h3>2.1 Introduction tab</h3>
<p>
  The Introduction tab explains the purpose of the tool, the three FETP tiers used in India and the main outputs shown in subsequent tabs. It summarises that the tool combines stakeholder preferences, cost information and epidemiological assumptions to provide endorsement estimates, cost and benefit metrics and scale up projections. The text on this tab is fixed and is intended to give non technical users an accessible entry point.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Attributes tab</h3>
<p>
  The Attributes tab lists the attributes and levels that were included in the discrete choice experiment. It shows the labels that appeared in the survey, the levels that respondents compared and the reference levels that are treated as the baseline in the econometric model. This makes it clear how the model coefficients used in the tool are linked to practical features of FETP design, such as programme duration, mentorship intensity and outbreak response time. Tooltip icons on this tab explain technical terms such as “reference level” or “alternative specific constant” using plain language.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Configuration tab</h3>
<p>
  The Configuration tab is where users define scenarios. For each scenario, users choose a tier, a career incentive, mentorship intensity, delivery mode and expected response time. They also select cohort size and number of cohorts and set a cost per trainee per month using a slider. The tool immediately recomputes the utility of the configured option, the probability that stakeholders endorse this option instead of the opt out alternative, the implied graduates and outbreak responses and the resulting benefits and costs.
</p>
<p>
  Tooltip icons next to each input explain what the choice means and how it enters the calculations. For example, the tooltip next to the cost slider explains that the discrete choice model uses cost measured in thousands of Indian rupees per trainee per month and that this is the main driver of both endorsement and cost per cohort. The tooltip next to the response time selector explains that faster response times are both strongly valued in the discrete choice experiment and treated as improving epidemiological benefits through response multipliers that can be adjusted in the Advanced settings tab.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Results tab</h3>
<p>
  The Results tab shows the core outputs for the current configuration. These are endorsement and opt out percentages, programme and economic cost per cohort, graduates per cohort, outbreak responses over the planning horizon, total epidemiological benefits, DCE based benefits and benefit cost ratios. The endorsement values come directly from the discrete choice model, while the costs and benefits are obtained using the assumptions described later in this appendix.
</p>
<p>
  Tooltip icons on this tab explain how endorsement is calculated, what is meant by programme cost and economic cost and how epidemiological and DCE based benefits are converted into monetary values. For users who only want a high level picture, this tab may be sufficient. For users who want to audit or adapt the calculations, later sections and the Advanced settings tab provide the needed detail.
</p>

<h3>2.5 Costing details tab</h3>
<p>
  The Costing details tab opens the black box of cost per trainee per month. It shows how the total programme cost per cohort implied by the cost slider is decomposed into staff, travel, materials, supervision, overhead and opportunity cost of trainee time. The shares used for this split come from cost templates that reflect current understanding of how FETP programmes are delivered in India and from World Health Organization guidance on training programme costing. These shares can be updated centrally in the configuration files if new costing studies become available.
</p>

<h3>2.6 National simulation tab</h3>
<p>
  The National simulation tab scales the per cohort costs and benefits to the national level using the number of cohorts chosen in the Configuration tab. Costs and benefits scale linearly with the number of cohorts. The benefit cost ratios remain unchanged because both numerator and denominator are multiplied by the same number. This tab also shows total graduates and outbreak responses over the planning horizon, making it easier to communicate national scale achievements rather than only per cohort outputs.
</p>

<h3>2.7 Saved scenarios tab</h3>
<p>
  The Saved scenarios tab records scenarios that the user chooses to store. For each scenario the tool keeps the inputs, the key outputs and the advanced assumptions in force when the scenario was saved. The table allows side by side comparison of endorsement, costs, benefits and benefit cost ratios across multiple scenarios. Users can export the table to Excel or JSON for further analysis. Tooltip icons on this tab explain how saved scenarios can be used for incremental cost benefit comparisons and how they relate to the Copilot tab.
</p>

<h3>2.8 Advanced settings tab</h3>
<p>
  The Advanced settings tab exposes the epidemiological and valuation assumptions that sit behind the benefit calculations. Users can edit planning horizon, graduation rates, outbreak response multipliers, value per graduate and value per outbreak response for each tier, as well as the exchange rate used for optional USD displays. These changes are applied instantly to all subsequent calculations. The tab also shows the default values and, where possible, short source notes or references. A separate section below explains these assumptions and their sources in more detail and suggests how users can adapt them as more local data become available.
</p>

<h3>2.9 Copilot tab</h3>
<p>
  The Copilot tab contains the soft Copilot integration. When users run scenarios in the Configuration and Results tabs and save those scenarios, the tool automatically prepares a structured text prompt that summarises the chosen scenarios, their costs, epidemiological benefits, DCE based benefits and key assumptions. The prompt also embeds a JSON representation of the scenarios. The Copilot tab displays this combined interpretation prompt and JSON clearly and provides a one click copy button. Users can then open Microsoft Copilot in a new browser tab, paste the text and ask Copilot to generate a narrative policy briefing, decision memo or slide outline based on the STEPS outputs.
</p>
<p>
  The Copilot tab does not send any data automatically to external services. It only prepares text for the user to copy. The tab assumes that users who wish to use Copilot have their own University of Newcastle or institutional Copilot access and that they are familiar with their organisation’s rules on sharing scenario information. The appendix section on the Copilot tab provides examples of what the prepared prompt looks like and how Copilot can help interpret outputs for different audiences.
</p>

<h3>2.10 Video guide tab</h3>
<p>
  The Video guide tab embeds a short video created using Microsoft Copilot, based on a script developed by the STEPS team. The video walks through the main tabs, explains the meaning of the inputs and outputs and highlights typical workshop use cases. The embedded player uses a standard secure iframe. Users can watch the video directly within the tool or open it in a separate window, depending on the hosting arrangement used by the project. The video does not change the calculations but can be a helpful starting point for new users.
</p>
</section> <!-- 3. PREFERENCE MODEL AND ENDORSEMENT --> <section id="sec-utility" class="appendix-section"> <h2>3. Preference model, utilities and endorsement</h2> <p> The tool uses a mixed logit model estimated on DCE data with an explicit opt out alternative. The model includes an alternative specific constant for the configured programme option, an alternative specific constant for the opt out option, dummy variables for non cost attributes and a linear cost term measured in thousands of rupees per trainee per month. The cost coefficient is negative, indicating that higher costs reduce the attractiveness of a configuration. </p> <p> For each configuration the tool constructs a non cost utility component by adding the relevant attribute coefficients and then adds the cost component obtained by multiplying the cost coefficient by the cost per trainee per month in thousands. The resulting total utility is compared with the utility of the opt out option. Endorsement is then calculated using the standard logit formula, which produces a value between zero and one. This value is displayed as an endorsement percentage, with the complement reported as the opt out percentage. </p> <div class="example-box"> <div class="example-title">Worked example: endorsement for an Advanced programme</div> <p> Consider an Advanced programme with high mentorship, blended delivery and response within 7 days. Suppose the combined non cost coefficient for these features, including the programme constant, is equal to 1.92. If cost per trainee per month is 75,000 INR and the cost coefficient is −0.005 per thousand rupees, the cost component is −0.005 times 75, which equals −0.375. Total utility for the programme is therefore 1.92 minus 0.375, which equals 1.545. </p> <p> If the opt out constant is −0.60, the utility difference between the programme and the opt out option is 0.60 plus 1.545, which equals 2.145. The corresponding endorsement probability from the logit formula is approximately 0.895. In the Results tab this would appear as around 90 percent endorsement and 10 percent opt out. If the user increases the cost slider, the cost component becomes more negative and endorsement falls. If the user reduces the cost slider, endorsement increases. </p> </div> <p> Tooltip icons next to the endorsement outputs summarise this process in a single sentence and point users to this appendix for full details. The discrete choice methods on which this is based are well established in health economics and transport economics. Standard references include Louviere, Hensher and Swait and Train’s text on discrete choice methods with simulation, which provide the theoretical background for logit based models and mixed logit extensions.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} </p> </section> <!-- 4. WTP AND DCE BENEFITS --> <section id="sec-wtp" class="appendix-section"> <h2>4. DCE based benefit measures and willingness to pay</h2> <p> The discrete choice model includes a linear cost term. This allows attribute coefficients to be translated into monetary values using standard willingness to pay calculations. For each attribute level the tool calculates the marginal willingness to pay per trainee per month by dividing the attribute coefficient by the absolute value of the cost coefficient and multiplying by one thousand to convert from units of thousand rupees to rupees per trainee per month. </p> <p> These marginal willingness to pay values can be interpreted as the amount of monthly programme cost per trainee that stakeholders are prepared to sacrifice in exchange for a specific improvement, such as moving from low to high mentorship or from a 30 day response time to a 7 day response time, while holding other features constant. In line with recommendations for discrete choice experiments used in benefit–risk and economic evaluation, the tool uses these WTP values as one of several benefit indicators rather than as an exclusive decision rule.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} </p> <div class="example-box"> <div class="example-title">Worked example: WTP for faster outbreak response</div> <p> Suppose the mixed logit model implies a coefficient of 0.55 for reducing outbreak response time from 30 days to 15 days and a cost coefficient of −0.005. The implied willingness to pay per trainee per month in thousands of rupees is 0.55 divided by 0.005, which equals 110. In rupees per trainee per month this is 110,000. For a cohort of 30 trainees over 12 months the DCE based benefit for this attribute change is 110,000 multiplied by 30 and then by 12, which equals 39,600,000 rupees. </p> <p> If the tool user sets cohort size to 30 and programme duration to 12 months, the DCE based benefit table in the Results or Sensitivity tabs will show a value close to 39.6 million rupees for the response time improvement, adjusting slightly for rounding and other attribute choices. Users can compare this DCE based benefit with the incremental programme cost of investments needed to achieve faster response, as well as with the epidemiological benefits described later in this appendix. </p> </div> <p> The tool also constructs configuration level DCE based benefits by summing the marginal willingness to pay values for all non cost attribute levels included in the configuration and scaling by cohort size, number of months and number of cohorts. These DCE based benefits are reported alongside epidemiological benefits in the Sensitivity and Saved scenarios tabs. Tooltip icons next to the DCE benefit columns explain that these values are based on survey stated preferences rather than observed budget allocations and are best interpreted as relative measures for comparing design options rather than as hard budget ceilings.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} </p> </section> <!-- 5. COSTS --> <section id="sec-costs" class="appendix-section"> <h2>5. Cost assumptions, cost components and worked examples</h2> <p> The cost side of the tool begins with a simple user input: cost per trainee per month. This cost is multiplied by cohort size and programme duration to obtain programme cost per cohort. Programme cost per cohort is then decomposed into components based on cost shares from templates that reflect the typical structure of FETP programmes in India and similar settings. </p> <p> The main cost components are staff salaries and benefits, travel and per diem, materials and supplies, supervision and mentoring, overheads and the opportunity cost of trainee time. Templates draw on World Health Organization guidance for costing training and health security programmes, as well as context specific costing studies where available.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} </p>
<h3>5.1 Programme cost per cohort</h3>
<p>
  Programme cost per cohort is calculated by multiplying the user chosen cost per trainee per month by cohort size and by programme duration in months. This cost reflects direct financial outlays for delivering the training programme, such as salaries, travel, accommodation during workshops, teaching materials and venue costs. This is the value shown as programme cost in the Results and Costing details tabs when the opportunity cost toggle is switched off.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: programme cost for an Intermediate cohort</div>
  <p>
    Suppose the user configures an Intermediate programme of 12 months with a cost per trainee per month of 150,000 rupees and a cohort size of 30 trainees. Programme cost per cohort is 150,000 multiplied by 30 and then by 12, which equals 54,000,000 rupees. This value appears in the Results and Costing details tabs as the programme cost per cohort before adding opportunity cost.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>5.2 Opportunity cost and economic cost</h3>
<p>
  Opportunity cost reflects the value of the time that trainees spend away from their usual duties while participating in the programme. Country specific studies suggest that the opportunity cost of trainee time can represent between 10 and 30 percent of total programme cost, depending on salary levels, intensity of service disruption and the extent to which training is integrated into routine work.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
</p>
<p>
  In the tool, when the opportunity cost toggle is activated the economic cost per cohort is obtained by adding an opportunity cost component to the programme cost. The default opportunity cost share for each tier is specified in the cost configuration file and can be changed in future versions as new costing information becomes available.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: adding opportunity cost</div>
  <p>
    Using the Intermediate example above with a programme cost of 54,000,000 rupees, suppose the template specifies that opportunity cost is equal to 20 percent of programme cost. The opportunity cost component is therefore 0.20 multiplied by 54,000,000, which equals 10,800,000 rupees. Economic cost per cohort becomes 54,000,000 plus 10,800,000, which is 64,800,000 rupees. In the Costing details tab the opportunity cost row will show 10,800,000 rupees, and the total economic cost row will show 64,800,000 rupees.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>5.3 Cost components and shares</h3>
<p>
  To improve interpretability and alignment with programme budgets, the Costing details tab breaks programme cost per cohort into components using cost shares from templates. For each template, the shares for staff, travel, materials, supervision and overheads are based on either World Health Organization guidance on training cost categories or FETP specific costing exercises.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: decomposing costs using template shares</div>
  <p>
    Continuing with the Intermediate programme example, suppose the chosen cost template indicates that staff represent 45 percent of programme cost, travel 25 percent, materials 10 percent, supervision 15 percent and overheads 5 percent. With a programme cost of 54,000,000 rupees the component amounts are 24,300,000 rupees for staff, 13,500,000 for travel, 5,400,000 for materials, 8,100,000 for supervision and 2,700,000 for overheads. These values are shown line by line in the Costing details tab. If the user changes the cost per trainee per month or cohort size, all component amounts adjust proportionally while keeping the shares fixed.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  The tooltip icons next to each cost component remind users that the shares come from external templates and that these can be updated when more accurate local cost data become available. In many low and middle income settings, cost estimates for training and health security programmes are imprecise, and the purpose of the tool is to make these assumptions explicit rather than to claim precise estimates.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
</p>
</section> <!-- 6. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS --> <section id="sec-epi" class="appendix-section"> <h2>6. Epidemiological and other benefit assumptions</h2> <p> The tool converts graduates and outbreak responses into indicative monetary benefits using multipliers and values per unit. These benefit assumptions are intentionally simple and are designed to be updated as better evidence emerges. They are not intended to replace detailed health impact modelling but to provide an approximate monetary estimate of the gains from stronger epidemiological capacity that can be used in high level cost benefit comparisons. </p>
<h3>6.1 Graduates, outbreak responses and planning horizon</h3>
<p>
  For each tier the epidemiological configuration includes a graduation rate and an expected number of outbreak responses supported per cohort per year, conditional on endorsement. Graduates per cohort are calculated by multiplying cohort size by graduation rate and by endorsement. Outbreak responses per cohort per year are calculated by multiplying a tier specific outbreak multiplier by endorsement. The planning horizon, typically set at five years, reflects the period over which graduates and strengthened systems are assumed to contribute meaningfully to outbreak detection and response.
</p>
<p>
  The choice of a five year horizon is consistent with several global health security investment frameworks and with the time period of many FETP strategic plans.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} Users can adjust the planning horizon in the Advanced settings tab to reflect national preferences or new evidence.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Monetary value per graduate</h3>
<p>
  Assigning a monetary value to each graduate is challenging but necessary for constructing simple benefit measures. The default values per graduate in the tool are derived from a combination of salary scales, productivity gains and avoided outbreak costs reported in the literature on health workforce investments and field epidemiology training.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
</p>
<p>
  A practical interpretation is that the value per graduate represents the present value of the additional contributions that a trained field epidemiologist makes over the planning horizon, relative to a scenario without training. This includes better outbreak detection, improved analytic support to programmes and more effective use of resources. In the absence of precise country specific estimates, the tool uses rounded values that are easy to understand and adjust. For example, default values may be set at 400,000 rupees per Frontline graduate, 500,000 per Intermediate graduate and 600,000 per Advanced graduate, recognising the increasing responsibility and expected impact with higher tiers.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: graduate related benefits</div>
  <p>
    Suppose an Intermediate programme has a cohort size of 30 trainees, a graduation rate of 0.90 and endorsement of 0.80. Expected graduates per cohort are 30 multiplied by 0.90 and then by 0.80, which equals 21.6. If the value per graduate for Intermediate tier is set at 500,000 rupees, graduate related benefits per cohort are 21.6 multiplied by 500,000, which equals 10,800,000 rupees.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>6.3 Monetary value per outbreak response</h3>
<p>
  The value per outbreak response reflects the avoided costs of uncontrolled outbreaks, including health care costs, productivity losses and broader economic disruption. Empirical studies on the economic impact of outbreaks and on the returns to investments in preparedness provide wide ranges for these values, often in the tens of millions of rupees per significant event in the Indian context.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
</p>
<p>
  The tool therefore uses rounded default values such as 30 million rupees per outbreak response for Frontline and Intermediate tiers and 40 million rupees for Advanced tier, recognising the higher complexity and potential impact of Advanced graduates. These values are not precise estimates but plausible order of magnitude anchors that can be changed in the Advanced settings tab as more detailed national studies become available.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: outbreak related benefits</div>
  <p>
    For the Intermediate example above, suppose the tier specific outbreak multiplier is 0.5 expected responses per cohort per year at full endorsement. With endorsement of 0.80, expected responses per year become 0.40. Over a five year planning horizon this yields 0.40 multiplied by 5, which equals 2 expected outbreak responses. If the value per response is 30,000,000 rupees, outbreak related benefits are 2 multiplied by 30,000,000, which equals 60,000,000 rupees.
  </p>
  <p>
    Total epidemiological benefits per cohort are therefore graduate related benefits (10,800,000 rupees) plus outbreak related benefits (60,000,000 rupees), which equals 70,800,000 rupees. These are the numbers shown in the Results and National simulation tabs, subject to rounding.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>6.4 Response time and epidemiological uplift</h3>
<p>
  Faster response times can reduce the number of cases and deaths during outbreaks and limit economic disruption. To keep the tool simple while acknowledging this, response time is treated in two ways. First, faster response is valued directly through the discrete choice willingness to pay, as described earlier. Second, optional response time multipliers in the epidemiological configuration file allow outbreak related benefits to be increased when response is faster than 30 days. For example, a multiplier of 1.2 for 15 days and 1.5 for 7 days indicates that faster response yields 20 to 50 percent more epidemiological benefit than the base case.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: response time multipliers</div>
  <p>
    Returning to the Intermediate example with outbreak benefits of 60,000,000 rupees at 30 days, a multiplier of 1.2 for 15 days increases benefits to 72,000,000 rupees. A multiplier of 1.5 for 7 days increases benefits to 90,000,000 rupees. In the Results tab the value shown for epidemiological benefits reflects the response time chosen in the Configuration tab and the multipliers set in the Advanced settings tab.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Users can set the multipliers based on simple modelling exercises, literature on timeliness of response and outbreak control or country specific experience. Publications on International Health Regulations core capacities and joint external evaluations provide contextual information on the importance of timeliness for outbreak control, even if they do not provide direct monetary values.:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
</p>
</section> <!-- 7. ADVANCED SETTINGS --> <section id="sec-advanced" class="appendix-section"> <h2>7. Advanced settings and editable assumptions</h2> <p> The Advanced settings tab is the main place where users can change the epidemiological and valuation assumptions without editing code. Parameters available for editing include graduation rates, outbreak multipliers, values per graduate and per outbreak response, response time multipliers, planning horizon and the exchange rate used for optional USD displays. All these values are read from configuration files such as epi_config.json when the tool loads and can be changed interactively through the tab. </p> <p> Changing these parameters updates all benefit calculations, national results and cost benefit ratios from that point onwards. The discrete choice coefficients and cost templates are not affected by these edits. This separation allows preference and cost structures to remain anchored in empirical data while the mapping from physical outputs to monetary benefits is adjusted as new evidence becomes available. </p> <div class="example-box"> <div class="example-title">Worked example: updating value per outbreak response</div> <p> Suppose a new national study suggests that the economic impact of averting a large outbreak is closer to 50,000,000 rupees per event than the default 40,000,000. A technical user can open the Advanced settings tab, locate the field for value per outbreak response for the relevant tier and change 40,000,000 to 50,000,000. From that point onwards, outbreak related benefits and total benefits increase by 25 percent for configurations involving that tier, and the benefit cost ratios reported in the Results, National simulation and Saved scenarios tabs adjust accordingly. </p> </div> <div class="example-box"> <div class="example-title">Worked example: adjusting graduation rates</div> <p> If programme monitoring reveals that graduation rates for Intermediate cohorts have improved from 0.90 to 0.95 after curriculum strengthening, the user can change the graduation rate parameter for the Intermediate tier in the Advanced settings tab. Expected graduates per cohort increase proportionally, graduate related benefits rise and benefit cost ratios improve. This provides a simple way to reflect quality improvements in the tool without changing the underlying preference model. </p> </div> <p> Tooltip icons in the Advanced settings tab remind users that changes here affect all subsequent scenarios and that it is good practice to document any edits made during workshops or analyses. Where possible, links to external documents, such as national health security investment cases or costing studies, can be added to the tool documentation to justify particular parameter values.:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} </p> </section> <!-- 8. WORKED SCENARIOS --> <section id="sec-worked" class="appendix-section"> <h2>8. Full worked scenarios across all tabs</h2> <p> This section brings together the previous elements through two illustrative scenarios. The numbers are chosen to be realistic and to connect directly to the values used in the rest of the appendix. They are not intended to reflect actual policy recommendations but to demonstrate how the tool behaves. </p>
<h3>8.1 Scenario A: Advanced, high mentorship, fast response</h3>
<p>
  Scenario A corresponds to an Advanced programme of 24 months with high mentorship, blended delivery, response within 7 days, cost per trainee per month of 75,000 rupees, cohort size of 20, number of cohorts equal to 10, mixed logit preferences and opportunity cost included.
</p>
<p>
  In the Configuration tab the user selects Advanced tier, high mentorship, blended delivery, 7 day response, sets the cost slider to 75,000, defines cohort size as 20 and the number of cohorts as 10 and activates the opportunity cost toggle. In the Results tab endorsement appears close to 90 percent, with around 10 percent opting out. Programme cost per cohort is 75,000 multiplied by 20 and then by 24, which equals 36,000,000 rupees. If opportunity cost is set at 25 percent of programme cost, economic cost per cohort is 45,000,000 rupees.
</p>
<p>
  In the Costing details tab programme cost per cohort is split into staff, travel, materials, supervision and overhead components according to the template shares for Advanced tier. Opportunity cost appears as a separate line, and total economic cost is shown at the bottom of the table. In the National simulation tab national total cost is 45,000,000 multiplied by 10, which equals 450,000,000 rupees.
</p>
<p>
  Using the epidemiological assumptions for Advanced tier and endorsement of 0.895, the tool calculates around 17 graduates per cohort and roughly 0.72 outbreak responses per year per cohort. Over a five year horizon, outbreak related benefits are about 143,000,000 rupees per cohort and graduate related benefits are about 10,200,000 rupees, giving total epidemiological benefits of about 153,400,000 rupees per cohort. Subtracting economic cost per cohort yields a net benefit of approximately 108,400,000 rupees and a benefit cost ratio of around 3.4.
</p>
<p>
  In the DCE based benefit view the tool also computes configuration level willingness to pay benefits and endorsement adjusted willingness to pay benefits, which are used in the Sensitivity and Saved scenarios tabs. These values will generally be of similar order of magnitude to the epidemiological benefits if the valuation assumptions are coherent but will differ in level and distribution across configurations because they reflect stakeholder preferences rather than epidemiological modelling alone.
</p>

<h3>8.2 Scenario B: Intermediate, medium mentorship, moderate response time</h3>
<p>
  Scenario B corresponds to an Intermediate programme of 12 months with medium mentorship, blended delivery, response within 15 days, cost per trainee per month of 150,000 rupees, cohort size of 30, 15 cohorts and opportunity cost included.
</p>
<p>
  In the Configuration tab the user selects Intermediate tier, medium mentorship, blended delivery and 15 day response, sets cost to 150,000, cohort size to 30 and number of cohorts to 15 and turns on the opportunity cost toggle. In the Results tab endorsement appears around 70 to 75 percent, with the remainder opting out. Programme cost per cohort is 150,000 multiplied by 30 and by 12, which equals 54,000,000 rupees. If the template indicates an opportunity cost share of 20 percent, economic cost per cohort is 64,800,000 rupees.
</p>
<p>
  With a graduation rate of 0.90, outbreak multiplier of 0.5, value per graduate of 500,000 rupees, value per outbreak response of 30,000,000 rupees, planning horizon of five years and endorsement of 0.80, epidemiological benefits per cohort are around 70,800,000 rupees. Net benefit per cohort is therefore about 6,000,000 rupees and the benefit cost ratio is just above one. At national level, total cost for 15 cohorts is roughly 972,000,000 rupees and total benefits about 1,062,000,000 rupees.
</p>
<p>
  Comparing Scenarios A and B in the Saved scenarios tab allows users to see that the Advanced configuration has higher cost but also substantially higher benefits and a stronger benefit cost ratio, while the Intermediate configuration delivers more graduates nationally at a lower total cost. DCE based benefits add a further dimension by capturing the value stakeholders attach to design features such as mentorship and response time beyond what is captured in the epidemiological multipliers.
</p>
</section> <!-- 9. COPILOT AND VIDEO --> <section id="sec-copilot" class="appendix-section"> <h2>9. Copilot tab and video guide</h2>
<h3>9.1 Copilot tab</h3>
<p>
  The Copilot tab is a soft integration with Microsoft Copilot used at the University of Newcastle. The tab does not connect directly to any external service. Instead, it prepares a rich text prompt for the user that combines a plain language instruction and a JSON snapshot of selected scenarios. The instruction asks Copilot to use the scenario information to produce a structured policy briefing, including tables and narrative interpretation of endorsement, costs, DCE based benefits, epidemiological benefits, net benefits and benefit cost ratios.
</p>
<p>
  When the user navigates to the Copilot tab after configuring and saving scenarios, the tool automatically generates this prompt and displays it in a read only text box. A copy button allows the user to copy the full text with one click. The user then opens Microsoft Copilot in a new browser tab, pastes the copied text and submits the prompt. Copilot responds inside the institutional environment, using the pasted scenario JSON and instructions to generate a briefing note, slide outline or talking points that can be refined further.
</p>
<p>
  The key advantages of this approach are that no data are sent automatically outside the browser, that users retain full control over which scenarios are shared with Copilot and that the resulting analyses are anchored in the same numbers shown in the STEPS tool. Users who do not have Copilot access can ignore this tab and instead export scenario data to Excel or other tools.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Worked example: using the Copilot tab</div>
  <p>
    A policy team configures three scenarios, saves them and then visits the Copilot tab. The tool displays a prompt that begins with a sentence such as “You are an expert policy analyst helping to interpret results from an FETP scale up decision aid” and follows with a JSON block that lists the three scenarios, including their tiers, cohorts, endorsement, costs and benefits. The team clicks the copy button, opens Microsoft Copilot in their institutional account, pastes the text and asks for a three page briefing for the Ministry of Health that compares the scenarios, highlights trade offs and proposes a recommendation. Copilot generates the briefing using the provided numbers as its main inputs.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>9.2 Video guide</h3>
<p>
  The video guide embedded in the dedicated tab has been produced using Microsoft Copilot based on a script prepared by the tool developers. It walks through the tabs in the same order as this appendix, demonstrating how to configure scenarios, interpret results and use the Advanced settings. The video is particularly useful for first time users or for workshop participants who need a short orientation before hands on exercises.
</p>
<p>
  The video is embedded via a secure iframe pointing to the host platform agreed with the project partners. Audio and visual content are aligned with the written documentation. No calculations depend on the video, and users who cannot access it can rely entirely on this appendix and the on screen tooltips.
</p>
</section> <!-- 10. USE AND LIMITS --> <section id="sec-use" class="appendix-section"> <h2>10. Recommended use, limits and future updates</h2> <p> STEPS is intended as a support tool for ministries, partners and funders considering investments in field epidemiology training and health security. It is most useful for exploring alternative programme designs, testing the sensitivity of cost benefit metrics to different assumptions and structuring workshop discussions around trade offs between endorsement, cost and epidemiological impact. The combination of DCE based benefits and epidemiological benefits provides complementary perspectives on value that are rarely both available in traditional appraisals. </p> <p> At the same time the tool has clear limits. It does not model specific disease transmission pathways, does not capture all long term health outcomes and does not include full fiscal planning or detailed macroeconomic impacts. It relies on simplified assumptions for values per graduate and per outbreak response and assumes that these values apply uniformly across cohorts. The discrete choice model is based on stated preferences in a survey rather than on observed budget data, so DCE based benefits should be interpreted as preference indices rather than binding willingness to pay by any single actor.:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} </p> <p> Future updates may include calibration of benefit assumptions to more detailed economic analyses of health security investments, integration of time discounting, explicit linkage to International Health Regulations core capacity scores and expansion to other cadres of training. Users are encouraged to treat all assumptions as open to discussion, to document any changes made in the Advanced settings tab and to combine STEPS outputs with more detailed models where major investments are being considered. </p> </section> <!-- 11.
