Overview of the preference study and STEPS</h2> <p> STEPS is built on a discrete choice experiment that invited stakeholders to choose between pairs of FETP training options and an explicit opt out option in each choice screen. Each training option was described using the same attributes that appear in the Configuration tab of the tool: programme tier, career incentive, mentorship intensity, delivery mode, outbreak response time, and cost per trainee per month. By observing repeated choices, the study estimated how strongly respondents valued each feature and how sensitive they were to cost. Standard texts on discrete choice experiments and health economics give the theoretical background for this approach. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} </p> <p> STEPS combines three main input blocks. The first block is the mixed logit preference model estimated from the discrete choice data. The second block is a set of cost templates for different tiers and providers, drawing on World Health Organization, National Institute of Epidemiology, and National Centre for Disease Control costing work. The third block is an epidemiological configuration that links cohorts of trainees to graduates, outbreak responses, and indicative monetary values. Together these blocks allow users to explore how alternative FETP configurations perform in terms of endorsement, costs, and benefits. </p> <p> The tool is intended to support discussions with ministries of health, national public health institutes, and development partners. It is not intended to replace detailed transmission models or full economic evaluations with discounted health outcomes, but to provide a transparent bridge between FETP design choices, stakeholder preferences, and high level cost benefit indicators. The approach is consistent with broader economic evaluation methods used for health programmes. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} </p> <div class="summary-callout"> In practical terms the tool answers questions such as: if we move from a Frontline to an Intermediate programme with stronger mentorship and faster outbreak response, how does endorsement change, how do costs change, and what is the indicative net benefit when we combine epidemiological and preference based values. </div> </section> <!-- 2. PREFERENCE MODEL AND ENDORSEMENT --> <section id="sec-utility" class="appendix-section"> <h2>2. Preference model and endorsement</h2> <p> The STEPS calculations use the mean coefficients from a mixed logit model estimated on the discrete choice data. The model has an alternative specific constant for the training option, an alternative specific constant for the opt out option, dummy variables for each non cost attribute level, and a linear cost term measured in thousands of rupees per trainee per month. </p> <p> For any configuration the tool builds a utility score in two steps. First it adds together the constant and the coefficients for the selected attribute levels to form a non cost utility. Second it multiplies the cost per trainee per month (divided by one thousand) by the cost coefficient and adds this cost term. This total utility is then compared with the utility of the opt out alternative to obtain an endorsement probability. </p>
<h3>2.1 Mixed logit mean parameters used in the tool</h3>

<p>
  Frontline tier, government and partner certificate, low mentorship, blended delivery, and response within
  30 days are the reference levels with coefficients equal to zero. All changes in programme design are
  measured relative to that baseline.
</p>

<h3>2.2 From utilities to endorsement and opt out</h3>
<p>
  For a given configuration the tool first calculates the non cost utility by adding the constant and the
  coefficients for the selected tier, incentive, mentorship, delivery mode, and response time. It then converts
  the cost per trainee per month into thousands of rupees and multiplies this by the cost coefficient to obtain
  the cost utility. The total utility for the FETP option is the sum of non cost utility and cost utility.
</p>
<p>
  The opt out alternative has its own constant. The difference between the utility of the configured FETP option
  and the utility of opting out is then passed through a standard logistic function. The result is interpreted as
  the predicted share of stakeholders who would endorse the configuration when faced with a simple choice between
  that option and an explicit opt out. The remaining share is interpreted as those who would prefer to opt out.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 1: Advanced configuration with high mentorship</div>
  <p>
    Suppose the Configuration tab is set to an Advanced programme with a university qualification incentive,
    high mentorship, blended delivery, response within 7 days, and a cost of 75,000 rupees per trainee per month.
    Using the coefficients in Table 1, the non cost utility is the constant plus the coefficients for Advanced,
    university qualification, high mentorship, blended delivery (zero) and seven day response. Summing these gives
    a non cost utility of 1.922.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cost in thousands of rupees per month is 75. Multiplying this by the cost coefficient gives a cost
    utility of minus 0.375. The total utility for the FETP option is therefore 1.547. The opt out constant is
    minus 0.601, so the difference between the FETP utility and the opt out baseline is 2.148. Passing this
    through the logistic formula yields an endorsement rate of about 90 percent and an opt out rate of about
    10 percent. These values are the ones displayed in the Results tab.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  All endorsement results in STEPS follow exactly this logic. Changing any design element or the cost per trainee
  per month changes the utility and therefore the endorsement rate. This is consistent with standard mixed logit
  practice in the discrete choice literature. 
</p>
</section> <!-- 3. COSTS --> <section id="sec-costs" class="appendix-section"> <h2>3. Programme costs, economic costs, and cost shares</h2> <p> STEPS distinguishes between programme cost and economic cost. Programme cost covers direct financial expenditures such as staff time charged to the training programme, travel and per diem for trainees and supervisors, training materials, and overheads. Economic cost adds the opportunity cost of trainee time where this is relevant and available. The tool reports per cohort values and, when the National simulation tab is used, scales them up by the number of cohorts. </p>
<h3>3.1 Programme cost per cohort</h3>
<p>
  Programme cost per cohort is the simplest cost calculation in the tool. It multiplies the cost per trainee
  per month set in the Configuration tab by the number of trainees in the cohort and by the duration of the
  programme in months. Duration is implied by tier in the current version, with three months for Frontline,
  twelve months for Intermediate, and twenty four months for Advanced.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 2: Intermediate programme cost per cohort</div>
  <p>
    Consider an Intermediate configuration with a twelve month duration, a cohort size of thirty trainees,
    and a cost per trainee per month of 150,000 rupees. The programme cost per cohort is obtained by multiplying
    these three inputs. The result is 54,000,000 rupees. This is the value that appears in the Results and
    Costing details tabs when these settings are chosen.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>3.2 Economic cost and the role of opportunity cost</h3>
<p>
  In some FETP settings it is important to recognise that trainees are usually employed health workers who
  would have been working in their usual roles if they were not in training. Economic cost therefore adds an
  estimate of the value of their time while they are attending the programme. Opportunity cost assumptions in
  STEPS are taken from cost templates developed with WHO, NIE, and NCDC partners. These templates specify what
  share of programme cost should be treated as opportunity cost for each tier and provider.
</p>
<p>
  When the opportunity cost toggle in the Configuration tab is turned off the tool reports only programme cost.
  When it is turned on the tool adds the opportunity cost component implied by the chosen cost template to the
  programme cost and reports this sum as the economic cost per cohort. In the Costing details tab the opportunity
  cost item is shown as a separate row so that users can see how much it contributes to total cost.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 3: Economic cost with opportunity cost</div>
  <p>
    Return to the Intermediate example with a programme cost of 54,000,000 rupees. Suppose the selected cost
    template indicates that the opportunity cost of trainee time should be treated as twenty percent of programme
    cost. When the opportunity cost toggle is switched on the tool multiplies 54,000,000 by 0.20, giving an
    opportunity cost of 10,800,000 rupees. Economic cost per cohort becomes 64,800,000 rupees. As the user changes
    the cost per trainee per month or the cohort size, both programme cost and opportunity cost move together.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>3.3 Cost components and template shares</h3>
<p>
  Cost templates in STEPS store, for each tier and provider combination, a set of shares that describe how
  programme cost is distributed across staff, travel and per diem, training materials, supervision and mentoring,
  overheads, and opportunity cost. These shares are based on existing FETP costing work carried out by WHO, NIE,
  NCDC, and partners, which show that staff time and travel are usually the dominant cost drivers for FETP
  programmes. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
</p>
<p>
  The tool does not hard code rupee amounts for each component in the template. Instead it reads the shares and
  applies them to the programme cost implied by the current configuration. For each component the rupee amount is
  calculated as the component share multiplied by the programme cost per cohort. When opportunity cost is included
  its share is applied either to programme cost or to a separate base defined in the template and then added as a
  separate line.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 4: Applying a cost template</div>
  <p>
    Suppose the WHO Intermediate template indicates that staff account for forty five percent of programme cost,
    travel and per diem for twenty five percent, materials for ten percent, supervision and mentoring for fifteen
    percent, and overheads for five percent. If the programme cost per cohort is 54,000,000 rupees, the tool
    multiplies this base by each share to obtain the rupee amounts for each component. The Costing details tab will
    show the resulting staff, travel, materials, supervision, and overhead entries. If the user doubles the cost per
    trainee per month, each component doubles in rupee terms but the percentage distribution remains the same.
  </p>
</div>
</section> <!-- 4. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONFIGURATION --> <section id="sec-epi" class="appendix-section"> <h2>4. Epidemiological configuration and benefits</h2> <p> STEPS uses a deliberately simple epidemiological structure to link cohorts of trainees to public health outcomes. The goal is not to reproduce a full transmission model but to capture, in a transparent way, how additional graduates and outbreak responses supported by FETP programmes translate into economic benefits. The structure aligns with published descriptions of how FETP graduates contribute to surveillance and response capacity in many countries. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} </p>
<h3>4.1 Default epidemiological parameters</h3>
<p>
  The tool reads default epidemiological parameters from a configuration file. For each tier it stores the
  implied programme duration, the graduation rate, the expected number of outbreak responses per cohort per
  year, and two monetary values: the value per graduate and the value per outbreak response. The configuration
  also stores a planning horizon in years for outbreak related benefits and a display exchange rate for converting
  rupees into United States dollars in the interface.
</p>
<p>
  For the current calibration the default values are:
</p>
<table class="small-table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Duration (months)</th>
    <th>Graduation rate</th>
    <th>Outbreak responses per cohort per year</th>
    <th>Value per graduate (INR)</th>
    <th>Value per outbreak response (INR)</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Frontline</td>

    <td>0.90</td>
    <td>0.30</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Intermediate</td>
    <td>12</td>

    <td>0.80</td>
    <td>600,000</td>
    <td>40,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  These values are stylised. They are intended to be plausible and conservative when compared with published
  descriptions of FETP contributions to detection and control of outbreaks and with wider work on the economic
  returns to investment in epidemic preparedness. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
  Users can and should update them in the Advanced settings tab when local data become available.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Graduates and outbreak responses per cohort</h3>
<p>
  For each configuration the tool first calculates the expected number of graduates per cohort. This is the
  product of the cohort size, the graduation rate for the selected tier, and the endorsement rate from the
  preference model. Including endorsement reflects the idea that programmes with low stakeholder support are
  less likely to be funded or implemented in full.
</p>
<p>
  The expected number of outbreak responses supported by each cohort per year is obtained by multiplying the
  outbreaks per cohort per year parameter for the tier by the endorsement rate. This again reflects the idea
  that if stakeholders do not support a configuration it is unlikely to be fully implemented.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Step by step example for epidemiological outputs</h3>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 5: Intermediate cohort</div>
  <p>
    Consider an Intermediate programme with a cohort size of thirty trainees and an endorsement rate of eighty
    percent. The graduation rate is ninety percent. The expected number of graduates is found by multiplying
    thirty by 0.90 and then by 0.80. This gives 21.6 graduates. The outbreaks per cohort per year parameter
    is 0.5. Multiplying 0.5 by the endorsement rate of 0.80 gives 0.40 outbreak responses per year supported
    by this cohort. These values are the epidemiological outputs that appear in the Results and National
    simulation tabs.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>4.4 Response time and epidemiological uplift</h3>
<p>
  The response time attribute plays two roles in the tool. It is part of the preference model and therefore
  influences endorsement and willingness to pay. It can also be used, in the Advanced settings, to scale
  outbreak related benefits through response time multipliers. The idea is that faster detection and response
  generate higher health and economic benefits per outbreak response.
</p>
<p>
  The configuration file therefore allows users to specify simple multipliers for response within fifteen days
  and within seven days relative to a thirty day baseline. For example, a multiplier of 1.2 for fifteen days and
  1.5 for seven days would mean that outbreak related benefits are increased by twenty percent and fifty percent
  respectively when faster response times are achieved.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 6: Response time multiplier</div>
  <p>
    Suppose an Intermediate cohort supports 0.40 outbreak responses per year over a planning horizon of five
    years. The value per outbreak response is 30,000,000 rupees. With a thirty day response baseline, outbreak
    related benefits over the planning horizon are 0.40 multiplied by 30,000,000 and then multiplied by 5,
    giving 60,000,000 rupees. If the response time is improved to fifteen days and the multiplier has been set
    to 1.2 in the Advanced settings, the outbreak benefit becomes 72,000,000 rupees. If response is improved to
    seven days with a multiplier of 1.5 the outbreak benefit becomes 90,000,000 rupees. These changes in benefits
    are visible in the Results and National simulation tabs and can be compared with the extra costs needed to
    achieve faster response.
  </p>
</div>
</section> <!-- 5. MONETARY VALUATION OF EPI BENEFITS --> <section id="sec-monetary-benefits" class="appendix-section"> <h2>5. Monetary valuation of epidemiological benefits</h2> <p> STEPS attaches monetary values both to additional graduates and to outbreaks that are detected and managed with support from FETP trained staff. The values per graduate and per outbreak are not direct market prices. They are summary measures intended to capture a bundle of effects, such as avoided treatment costs, avoided productivity losses, and avoided social disruption, as well as the value of improved surveillance and response capacity. Global studies of pandemic risk and preparedness have shown that even moderate epidemics can create very large economic losses relative to the cost of preparedness investments, which motivates the use of positive values per outbreak response in cost benefit analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} </p>
<h3>5.1 Value per graduate</h3>
<p>
  The default value per graduate increases from 400,000 rupees for Frontline to 600,000 rupees for Advanced
  programmes. These values were chosen to satisfy three conditions. First, they should be large enough that
  programmes with realistic costs and endorsement rates have benefit cost ratios greater than one in plausible
  scenarios, in line with the broader economic case for investing in field epidemiology capacity. Second, they
  should be conservative in the sense that they sit well below the estimated economic losses associated with
  large outbreaks and pandemics. Third, they should increase with programme tier, reflecting the longer duration,
  more intensive curriculum, and stronger expected contribution of Intermediate and Advanced graduates to complex
  surveillance and response tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
</p>
<p>
  For any configuration the graduate related monetary benefit is calculated by multiplying the expected number
  of graduates per cohort by the value per graduate for the selected tier. If analysts have country specific
  estimates of the economic impact of FETP graduates, they can enter those values directly in the Advanced
  settings tab and the tool will update all benefit and cost benefit outputs automatically.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Value per outbreak response</h3>
<p>
  The default value per outbreak response is 30,000,000 rupees for Frontline and Intermediate programmes and
  40,000,000 rupees for Advanced programmes. These values are intended to approximate the order of magnitude
  of avoided costs when a moderately sized outbreak is detected and controlled early by FETP trained staff,
  based on published work on the economic burden of infectious disease outbreaks and on the expected global
  losses associated with pandemics. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
</p>
<p>
  The outbreak related benefit per cohort is calculated as the expected number of outbreak responses per year
  supported by the cohort, multiplied by the value per outbreak response, and then multiplied by the planning
  horizon in years. Response time multipliers, if activated, are applied after this calculation. This structure
  is simple but allows users to see the direct effect of changing the value per outbreak response or the planning
  horizon in the Advanced settings tab.
</p>

<h3>5.3 Combined epidemiological benefit per cohort</h3>
<p>
  For each configuration the total epidemiological benefit per cohort is the sum of the graduate related benefit
  and the outbreak related benefit. In symbolic form it is the expected graduates multiplied by the value per
  graduate plus the expected outbreak responses over the planning horizon multiplied by the value per outbreak
  response and any response time multiplier. This total is one of the main benefit measures reported in the
  Results and National simulation tabs.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 7: Advanced cohort with epidemiological benefits</div>
  <p>
    Consider an Advanced cohort with twenty trainees, an endorsement rate of ninety percent, a graduation rate
    of ninety five percent, an outbreaks per cohort per year parameter of 0.8, a value per graduate of 600,000
    rupees, a value per outbreak response of 40,000,000 rupees, and a planning horizon of five years. The expected
    number of graduates is 20 multiplied by 0.95 and by 0.90, which gives 17.1 graduates. The graduate related
    benefit is therefore 10,260,000 rupees. The expected number of outbreak responses per year supported by the
    cohort is 0.8 multiplied by 0.90, which gives 0.72. Over five years this becomes 3.6 responses. Multiplying
    by 40,000,000 rupees per response gives an outbreak related benefit of 144,000,000 rupees. The combined
    epidemiological benefit per cohort is therefore 154,260,000 rupees.
  </p>
</div>
</section> <!-- 6. WTP AND DCE BENEFITS --> <section id="sec-wtp" class="appendix-section"> <h2>6. Willingness to pay and DCE based benefits</h2> <p> In addition to epidemiological benefits, STEPS can construct benefit measures based on willingness to pay implied by the discrete choice experiment. The idea is standard in the DCE literature. If the model contains a linear cost term, each attribute coefficient can be expressed in rupee terms by dividing it by the cost coefficient. This gives the amount of cost per trainee per month that respondents are willing to give up in order to obtain that attribute change, holding other features constant. </p>
<h3>6.1 Attribute level willingness to pay</h3>
<p>
  For the mixed logit coefficients in Table 1, the marginal willingness to pay for each attribute level is the
  attribute coefficient divided by the absolute value of the cost coefficient and then multiplied by one thousand
  to convert from thousands of rupees to rupees per trainee per month. For example, the coefficient for high
  mentorship is 0.640. Dividing by 0.005 gives 128 in thousands of rupees, or 128,000 rupees per trainee per
  month. This means that, on average, respondents value high mentorship as much as an increase of about 128,000
  rupees per trainee per month in programme cost.
</p>
<p>
  Table 2 shows the implied willingness to pay values for a subset of attributes.

<h3>6.2 Configuration level DCE benefits</h3>
<p>
  For a given configuration the tool can construct a DCE based benefit per trainee per month by adding the
  willingness to pay values for all attribute levels that are switched on in that configuration relative to
  the reference levels. This total willingness to pay per trainee per month can then be converted into a
  per cohort benefit by multiplying by the number of trainees and by the programme duration in months.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 8: Total willingness to pay for a configuration</div>
  <p>
    Suppose an Intermediate configuration with high mentorship, blended delivery, and response within fifteen
    days is under consideration. Using the coefficients in Table 1, the willingness to pay values relative to
    the Frontline baseline are roughly 44,000 rupees per trainee per month for moving from Frontline to
    Intermediate, 128,000 rupees for moving from low to high mentorship, and 109,200 rupees for moving from
    thirty day to fifteen day response time. Adding these gives a total willingness to pay of 281,200 rupees
    per trainee per month for that design, relative to a basic Frontline arrangement with low mentorship and
    thirty day response.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the cohort size is thirty trainees and the programme runs for twelve months, the DCE based benefit per
    cohort is 281,200 multiplied by thirty and then by twelve. This equals 101,232,000 rupees. This figure can
    be compared directly with the programme or economic cost per cohort to obtain a cost benefit ratio based
    purely on preferences.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>6.3 Endorsement weighted DCE benefits</h3>
<p>
  The configuration level DCE benefit described above assumes that the configuration is fully adopted. To
  reflect the fact that some stakeholders may oppose it, STEPS also calculates an endorsement weighted DCE
  benefit. This is found by multiplying the DCE based benefit per cohort by the endorsement rate. If a
  configuration has a very high DCE based benefit but low endorsement, the endorsement weighted benefit will
  be much lower, signalling that it may be challenging to implement in practice.
</p>
</section> <!-- 7. NATIONAL SIMULATION AND CBA --> <section id="sec-national" class="appendix-section"> <h2>7. National simulation and cost benefit metrics</h2> <p> The National simulation tab takes the per cohort costs and benefits described above and scales them by the number of cohorts entered in the Configuration tab. This is helpful when users want to consider a national roll out of a given design, such as ten Advanced cohorts or a mixed portfolio of Frontline and Intermediate cohorts in different states. </p>
<h3>7.1 Scaling costs and benefits to the national level</h3>
<p>
  National economic cost is the economic cost per cohort multiplied by the number of cohorts. National
  epidemiological benefits are the per cohort benefits multiplied by the number of cohorts. The same scaling
  applies to DCE based benefits. Because both costs and benefits are multiplied by the same factor, the benefit
  cost ratio at the national level is the same as the per cohort benefit cost ratio.
</p>

<h3>7.2 Net benefit and benefit cost ratio</h3>
<p>
  For each configuration the tool reports net benefit and a benefit cost ratio based on the epidemiological
  benefit measure. Net benefit per cohort is the epidemiological benefit per cohort minus the economic cost per
  cohort. The benefit cost ratio is the epidemiological benefit per cohort divided by the economic cost per
  cohort. When DCE based benefits are activated in the Sensitivity and DCE benefits tab, the tool can also
  report net benefits and benefit cost ratios that include DCE based benefits either on their own or combined
  with epidemiological benefits.
</p>
<div class="example-box">
  <div class="example-title">Example 9: National simulation for an Advanced configuration</div>
  <p>
    Suppose the Advanced configuration in Example 7 has an economic cost per cohort of 45,000,000 rupees and an
    epidemiological benefit per cohort of 154,260,000 rupees. The net benefit per cohort is therefore 109,260,000
    rupees and the benefit cost ratio is about 3.4. If the number of cohorts is set to ten, the national economic
    cost is 450,000,000 rupees, the national epidemiological benefit is 1,542,600,000 rupees, and the national net
    benefit is 1,092,600,000 rupees. The benefit cost ratio remains about 3.4 at the national level.
  </p>
</div>
</section> <!-- 8. EXTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS --> <section id="sec-assumptions" class="appendix-section"> <h2>8. External assumptions and how to change them</h2> <p> STEPS deliberately separates structure from parameters. The structure is the set of formulas described in the previous sections. The parameters are the numerical assumptions in the cost templates, the epidemiological configuration, and the value per graduate and per outbreak response. This section explains where these assumptions come from, why they are plausible, and how users can update them. </p>
<h3>8.1 Cost templates</h3>
<p>
  The cost templates reflect existing costing work for Frontline, Intermediate, and Advanced FETP programmes
  conducted by WHO, NIE, NCDC, and partners in India and other countries. These studies show that staff time and
  travel usually account for the largest shares of cost, with materials, supervision, and overheads making up the
  remainder. 
</p>
<p>
  In the tool the templates are implemented as shares rather than fixed rupee amounts so that users can adjust
  the cost per trainee per month while preserving a realistic cost structure. If new costing studies become
  available, users can update the shares and the implied opportunity cost in the underlying configuration files
  or directly in the tool if that functionality is exposed.
</p>

<h3>8.2 Epidemiological parameters</h3>
<p>
  Graduation rates and outbreak frequencies are drawn from monitoring data and from published descriptions of
  FETP outputs. For example, evaluations of FETP programmes document high graduation rates and repeated
  involvement of trainees and graduates in outbreak investigations and responses. 
  The default outbreak frequencies in STEPS are set at levels that are consistent with these descriptions but
  remain conservative for planning purposes.
</p>
<p>
  Users can change graduation rates and outbreak frequencies in the Advanced settings when local data are
  available. For example, if a national FETP programme tracks the number of outbreak investigations led by its
  Advanced graduates each year, those values can be translated into an outbreaks per cohort per year parameter
  and entered directly.
</p>

<h3>8.3 Monetary values for graduates and outbreaks</h3>
<p>
  The monetary values per graduate and per outbreak response are informed by two strands of evidence. The first
  strand is the qualitative and quantitative literature on the contribution of FETP graduates to surveillance
  and response capacity, which shows that FETP trained staff play a central role in detection, investigation,
  and control of priority diseases.  The second strand is the economic
  literature on pandemic risk and on the economic case for investment in epidemic preparedness, which finds that
  the expected economic losses from pandemics are large relative to the cost of preparedness interventions. 
</p>
<p>
  The default values per graduate and per outbreak response in STEPS are set so that resulting benefit cost
  ratios fall within the range suggested by global investment cases for health security but remain cautious
  enough to avoid overstating the case for any single configuration. Users who have country specific valuations
  can replace the defaults with their own numbers in the Advanced settings tab.
</p>

<h3>8.4 What users can do in future</h3>
<p>
  As new data become available, analysts can use STEPS as a living decision aid. Updated FETP costing studies
  can feed directly into new templates. Monitoring data on graduates and outbreak investigations can refine the
  epidemiological parameters. New studies on the economic burden of outbreaks and the benefits of preparedness
  can refine the monetary values. The structure of the tool does not need to change. Only the configuration
  files and the Advanced settings inputs do.
</p>
</section> <!-- 9. TAB BY TAB EXPLANATION --> <section id="sec-tabs" class="appendix-section"> <h2>9. Tab by tab explanation, including Copilot and video guide</h2> <p> This section describes each tab in the STEPS interface and links it back to the formulas and assumptions described earlier. </p>
<h3>9.1 Introduction tab</h3>
<p>
  The Introduction tab provides a narrative overview of FETP tiers, the motivation for the tool, and the main
  types of outputs that users can expect. It summarises the discrete choice experiment, the cost templates, and
  the epidemiological configuration in plain language. The text in that tab is static and does not depend on
  user inputs.
</p>

<h3>9.2 Attributes tab</h3>
<p>
  The Attributes tab lists each attribute that appeared in the discrete choice experiment, the levels for each
  attribute, the reference level used in the econometric model, and the corresponding variable name in the code.
  This tab serves as a transparent map between survey language, programme design language, and the model coding
  used in the utility function.
</p>

<h3>9.3 Configuration tab</h3>
<p>
  The Configuration tab is the main input tab. Users select the tier, career incentive, mentorship intensity,
  delivery mode, outbreak response time, cost per trainee per month, cohort size, number of cohorts, and whether
  to include opportunity cost. As soon as any of these inputs change, the tool recalculates utility, endorsement,
  costs, epidemiological outputs, and benefits. These recalculations follow the steps described in Sections 2 to 7.
</p>

<h3>9.4 Results tab</h3>
<p>
  The Results tab displays the central outcomes for the current configuration. These include the endorsement
  and opt out percentages, programme and economic cost per cohort, the combined epidemiological benefit per
  cohort, net benefit, and the benefit cost ratio. When DCE based benefits are activated, the tab also shows
  summary willingness to pay values for key attributes and may show combined benefit cost indicators that add
  DCE based benefits to epidemiological benefits.
</p>

<h3>9.5 Costing details tab</h3>
<p>
  The Costing details tab breaks the total programme cost per cohort into its component shares for staff,
  travel and per diem, training materials, supervision and mentoring, overheads, and opportunity cost. It also
  displays the total economic cost per cohort when opportunity cost is included. The entries in this tab are
  obtained directly from the cost templates and from the chosen cost per trainee per month, as described in
  Section 3.
</p>

<h3>9.6 Epidemiology and benefits tab (if present)</h3>
<p>
  In some implementations an explicit epidemiology and benefits tab is included. This tab shows, for the
  current configuration, the expected number of graduates per cohort, the expected number of outbreak responses
  per year, and the resulting graduate related, outbreak related, and total epidemiological benefits. Where
  response time multipliers are active, the tab may also show how benefits change when moving from thirty day
  to fifteen day or seven day response.
</p>

<h3>9.7 National simulation tab</h3>
<p>
  The National simulation tab scales cohort level values by the number of cohorts. It shows national totals
  for economic cost, epidemiological benefits, net benefit, graduates, and outbreak responses, together with
  the benefit cost ratio. The calculations follow Section 7.
</p>

<h3>9.8 Saved scenarios tab</h3>
<p>
  The Saved scenarios tab allows users to store configurations of interest. Each saved scenario records the
  configuration inputs, endorsement, costs, epidemiological benefits, and cost benefit results. Saved scenarios
  can usually be exported in JSON or spreadsheet formats, allowing users to carry out further analysis, such
  as incremental comparisons between two or three leading options.
</p>

<h3>9.9 Sensitivity and DCE benefits tab</h3>
<p>
  The Sensitivity and DCE benefits tab presents, in table form, the cost and benefit metrics for all saved
  scenarios. For each scenario the table includes at least economic cost per cohort, epidemiological benefit
  per cohort, DCE based benefit per cohort, endorsement, endorsement weighted DCE benefit, net benefits, and
  benefit cost ratios based on epidemiological benefits alone, DCE based benefits alone, and combined benefits.
  All numbers in this tab are derived using the methods described in Sections 3 to 7 and allow users to see,
  at a glance, which configurations perform well under different assumptions about what counts as a benefit.
</p>

<h3>9.10 Advanced settings tab</h3>
<p>
  The Advanced settings tab exposes the main epidemiological and valuation parameters. Users can view and
  edit graduation rates, outbreaks per cohort per year, values per graduate, values per outbreak response,
  the planning horizon, the display exchange rate, and, where configured, response time multipliers. Changes
  made here take effect immediately in all other tabs, allowing users to see how sensitive the results are to
  these external assumptions.
</p>

<h3>9.11 Copilot tab</h3>
<p>
  The Copilot tab is a soft integration between the STEPS tool and Microsoft Copilot. The tab does not send
  any data automatically to external services. Instead it prepares a complete text package that users can
  copy and paste into their own Copilot environment.
</p>
<p>
  The Copilot tab works in three steps. First, it retrieves the current scenario configuration and results,
  including the main inputs, endorsement, costs, benefits, and key cost benefit indicators. Second, it combines
  this scenario specific JSON data with a carefully written policy interpretation prompt. This combined text
  explains to Copilot how to read the JSON, how to summarise the scenario, and how to produce a structured
  policy briefing with tables, narrative interpretation, and discussion of trade offs between endorsement,
  epidemiological benefits, DCE based benefits, costs, benefit cost ratios, and net benefits. Third, it displays
  the full combined text in a readable box and provides a one click copy button.
</p>
<p>
  Users are instructed, on screen, to run their analysis inside STEPS, navigate to the Copilot tab, review the
  automatically generated text, press the copy button, open Microsoft Copilot in a new browser tab, and paste
  the copied text into a new Copilot chat. The University of Newcastle uses Microsoft 365 Copilot, and the
  prompt has been written and tested with that environment in mind, but the same text can be used with any
  Copilot instance that the user has access to. The key point is that the user remains in control of when and
  how any scenario data leave the STEPS tool.
</p>
<p>
  Once the text is pasted into Copilot, Copilot can generate a detailed policy briefing that is tailored to
  the specific configuration and results. This can include narrative sections for senior decision makers,
  technical annexes for analysts, and recommended next steps. The Copilot tab therefore acts as a bridge
  between the quantitative outputs of STEPS and the written products that are needed for briefings, business
  cases, and funding proposals.
</p>

<h3>9.12 Video guide tab</h3>
<p>
  The video guide tab embeds a short instructional video that walks through the main steps in using the tool.
  The video has been produced using Microsoft Copilot, based on a script prepared by the tool developer, and
  is hosted on a secure platform. It shows how to select a configuration, interpret endorsement and cost
  results, inspect the cost breakdown and epidemiological outputs, run a national simulation, save scenarios,
  and use the Copilot tab. The video is particularly useful for new users who prefer to see the tool in action
  rather than reading detailed documentation.
</p>

<h3>9.13 About and Technical appendix tabs</h3>
<p>
  The About tab gives a concise description of the discrete choice experiment, the costing and epidemiological
  modules, and the main limitations of the current version. It also provides a link to this technical appendix,
  which opens in a separate browser tab. The present document is the Technical appendix itself and is intended
  to provide all the detail needed for replication, adaptation, and critical review.
</p>
</section> <!-- 10. TOOLTIPS --> <section id="sec-tooltips" class="appendix-section"> <h2>10. Tooltip icons and on screen explanations</h2> <p> Throughout the STEPS interface small information icons appear next to many labels and input fields. These icons open tooltip text when hovered over or clicked. They are an integral part of the documentation and are designed to match, in concise form, the explanations provided in this appendix. </p> <p> Typical tooltips explain the meaning of programme tiers, the difference between programme cost and economic cost, the definition of endorsement and opt out, the interpretation of the value per graduate and value per outbreak response parameters, and the role of the planning horizon. In the Advanced settings tab, tooltips also explain that changes to graduation rates, outbreak frequencies, and monetary values should normally be based on monitoring data or formal analyses rather than arbitrary guesses. </p> <p> When using the tool it is helpful to think of the tooltips as short summaries and of this appendix as the detailed reference. If any tooltip seems ambiguous, the corresponding section in this appendix normally provides the fuller explanation and a worked example. </p> </section> <!-- 11. WORKED CONFIGURATION --> <section id="sec-worked" class="appendix-section"> <h2>11. Worked configuration that links all tabs</h2> <p> This section presents one complete configuration and follows it through all the main tabs in the tool. The numbers match, up to rounding, the calculations described earlier. </p>
<h3>11.1 Configuration choices</h3>
<p>
  Consider an Advanced programme with the following settings. Tier is Advanced with a twenty four month duration.
  The career incentive is a university qualification. Mentorship intensity is high. Delivery mode is blended.
  Outbreak response time is set to seven days. The cost per trainee per month is 75,000 rupees. The cohort size
  is twenty trainees. The number of cohorts is ten. Opportunity cost is included and an Advanced cost template
  with a twenty five percent opportunity cost share is selected. Default epidemiological parameters and monetary
  values are used.
</p>

<h3>11.2 Results tab</h3>
<p>
  Using the coefficients in Table 1, the non cost utility for this configuration is 1.922. The cost utility is
  minus 0.375, giving a total utility of 1.547. Combined with the opt out constant this implies an endorsement
  rate of about ninety percent. Programme cost per cohort is 36,000,000 rupees. With a twenty five percent
  opportunity cost share, economic cost per cohort is 45,000,000 rupees.
</p>
<p>
  With an endorsement rate of ninety percent, a graduation rate of ninety five percent, a value per graduate of
  600,000 rupees, an outbreaks per cohort per year parameter of 0.8, a value per outbreak response of
  40,000,000 rupees, and a five year planning horizon, the epidemiological benefit per cohort is about
  154,000,000 rupees. Net benefit per cohort is therefore just over 109,000,000 rupees and the benefit cost
  ratio is a little over 3.4. These values appear in the Results tab.
</p>

<h3>11.3 Costing details tab</h3>
<p>
  In the Costing details tab the programme cost per cohort of 36,000,000 rupees is split across staff, travel,
  materials, supervision, and overheads according to the Advanced cost template. For example, if staff have a
  forty percent share, their cost is 14,400,000 rupees. Opportunity cost appears as a separate entry of
  9,000,000 rupees. The economic cost of 45,000,000 rupees is shown as the sum of the programme and opportunity
  cost rows.
</p>

<h3>11.4 Epidemiology and benefits tab</h3>
<p>
  The epidemiology and benefits tab shows that the expected number of graduates per cohort is just over seventeen
  and that the expected number of outbreak responses per year per cohort is about 0.72. The graduate related
  benefit is slightly above ten million rupees and the outbreak related benefit over the five year horizon is
  about 144,000,000 rupees. The total epidemiological benefit matches the value reported in the Results tab.
</p>

<h3>11.5 National simulation tab</h3>
<p>
  With ten cohorts the national economic cost is 450,000,000 rupees and the national epidemiological benefit is
  about 1,540,000,000 rupees. National net benefit is therefore a little over 1,090,000,000 rupees. The national
  benefit cost ratio is still about 3.4. The tab also reports that there are roughly 170 graduates and just over
  seven outbreak responses per year supported across all ten cohorts.
</p>

<h3>11.6 Sensitivity and DCE benefits tab</h3>
<p>
  If DCE based benefits are activated, the Sensitivity and DCE benefits tab will display, for this scenario, the
  DCE based benefit per cohort, the endorsement weighted DCE benefit per cohort, and combined cost benefit
  metrics that add the DCE based benefit to the epidemiological benefit. Users can then compare this scenario
  with, for example, an Intermediate scenario that has lower cost and lower benefits using both epidemiological
  and DCE based indicators.
</p>

<h3>11.7 Copilot tab and briefing generation</h3>
<p>
  When the user navigates to the Copilot tab with this configuration active, the tab prepares a combined prompt
  that includes a short explanation of the policy question, the scenario specific JSON with all the inputs and
  outputs described above, and instructions to Copilot on how to structure a briefing. Pressing the copy button
  copies this text to the clipboard. Pasting it into Microsoft Copilot allows the user to obtain a narrative
  briefing that explains, in words and tables, the endorsement, costs, benefits, and trade offs for this Advanced
  configuration, suitable for inclusion in slides or business cases.
</p>
</section> <!-- 12. USE AND LIMITS --> <section id="sec-use" class="appendix-section"> <h2>12. Recommended use and limits</h2> <p> STEPS is designed as a transparent decision aid rather than a forecasting tool. It works best when used to compare a small set of realistic FETP configurations, identify those with strong endorsement and positive net benefits, and then serve as an input into more detailed planning and modelling exercises. It is also useful as a teaching and workshop tool, helping stakeholders understand how preferences, costs, and basic epidemiological assumptions interact. </p> <p> The tool does not replace full transmission models, long term fiscal planning models, or detailed economic evaluations with discounted health outcomes. Instead it complements them by making explicit the role of stakeholder preferences and by providing simple but interpretable benefit measures that can be linked to wider evidence on the economic case for investing in health security and field epidemiology capacity. </p> </section> <!-- 13.
