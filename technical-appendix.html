        <h2>Technical Appendix – Cost and Benefit Calculations in the STEPS FETP India Tool</h2>

        <p>
            This appendix explains how the STEPS FETP India decision aid converts discrete choice experiment
            (DCE) results into predicted endorsement, willingness to pay (WTP), monetary benefits and
            benefit cost ratios for specific programme scenarios. All calculations in this appendix use:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>50 trainees per cohort;</li>
            <li>10 cohorts in total (that is 500 trainees altogether);</li>
            <li>a constant annual discount rate of 3 percent;</li>
            <li>a five year time horizon for benefits and costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Monetary values are expressed in Indian rupees. The cost attribute in the DCE
            is measured as cost per trainee per month in thousands of rupees (₹000).

        <h3>1. Mixed logit model used in the STEPS tool</h3>

        <p>
            The STEPS tool is based on a mixed logit (MXL) model estimated from the stakeholder discrete
            choice experiment. The model produces a utility score for each training programme and for the
            opt out option. The key mean coefficients used in the tool are:

        <p>
            For any scenario the tool first calculates a utility score that ignores cost (the
            non cost utility) by adding the relevant coefficients from the table above. It then
            subtracts the cost effect, which is the cost coefficient multiplied by the cost level
            in thousands of rupees per month.

        <h3>2. From utility scores to endorsement probabilities</h3>

        <p>
            The probability that stakeholders choose a particular programme instead of opting
            out is calculated using the standard logit formula. The tool compares the utility
            for the programme with the utility for the opt out option:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Example for Scenario S5</strong> (Intermediate, Medium mentoring, Blended delivery,
            Government and partner certificate, response within 7 days, cost ₹75,000 per trainee per month):
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Non cost utility for S5 is calculated by adding the relevant coefficients:<br>
                0.168 (programme constant) + 0.220 (intermediate) + 0.453 (medium mentoring)
                + 0.000 (blended delivery) + 0.000 (certificate)
                + 0.610 (response within 7 days) = <strong>1.451</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cost level is 75 on the ₹000 scale. The cost effect is
                -0.005 × 75 = -0.375. The full programme utility for S5 is therefore
                1.451 - 0.375 = <strong>1.076</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The utility for the opt out option is the constant only, which is <strong>-0.601</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The endorsement probability is then the exponential of 1.076 divided by the
                sum of the exponentials of 1.076 and -0.601. This gives a predicted endorsement
                rate for S5 of <strong>about 84.3 percent</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The same procedure is applied in the tool for each scenario and for any user defined
            configuration of the attributes.

        <h3>3. From utility scores to willingness to pay</h3>

        <p>
            The DCE also provides a way to express the overall value of a programme in monetary
            terms. The cost coefficient tells us how utility changes when cost increases by
            ₹1000 per trainee per month. Because the coefficient is -0.005, a cost increase of
            ₹1000 reduces utility by 0.005 units.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a given programme, the non cost utility represents the extra utility relative
            to a reference programme at the same cost. The willingness to pay per trainee per
            month that would compensate for this difference is obtained by dividing the non
            cost utility by the absolute value of the cost coefficient and then multiplying
            by 1000 to convert back to rupees:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>WTP per trainee per month</strong> = (non cost utility ÷ 0.005) × 1000.
        </p>

        <p>
            For Scenario S5 the non cost utility is 1.451. The implied willingness to pay
            per trainee per month is:
        </p>

        <p>
            (1.451 ÷ 0.005) × 1000 = 290,200 rupees per trainee per month.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means stakeholders value the combination of intermediate training, medium mentoring,
            blended delivery, a government and partner certificate and a seven day outbreak response
            capacity at about ₹290,200 per trainee per month compared with the reference programme.

        <h3>4. Aggregating WTP to benefits for 50 trainees and 10 cohorts</h3>

        <p>
            The STEPS tool aggregates willingness to pay across trainees and cohorts to
            obtain annual monetary benefits for a selected configuration. The steps are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Multiply the WTP per trainee per month by the number of trainees in one cohort.
                With 50 trainees per cohort and S5 WTP of ₹290,200 per trainee per month,
                the benefit per cohort per month is:<br>
                290,200 × 50 = <strong>14,510,000 rupees</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiply by the number of cohorts. With 10 cohorts the total monthly benefit is:<br>
                14,510,000 × 10 = <strong>145,100,000 rupees</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiply by 12 to obtain annual benefits. For S5 the annual WTP based benefit
                across 10 cohorts is:<br>
                145,100,000 × 12 = <strong>1,741,200,000 rupees</strong>
                (that is 1,741.2 million rupees).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The STEPS tool repeats this calculation automatically for any scenario chosen in
            the configuration tab, using the current cohort size and number of cohorts entered
            by the user.

        <h3>5. Discounting and the present value factor</h3>

        <p>
            To compare costs and benefits over time the tool converts the future annual benefits
            and costs into a five year present value using a constant discount rate of 3 percent.
            If the annual benefit is the same in each year, the present value can be written as
            the annual benefit multiplied by a present value factor.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a five year horizon and a 3 percent discount rate, the discount factor for each year is:
        </p>

        <table class="appendix-table">

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            Adding these five factors gives the present value factor:
        </p>

        <p>
            0.9708737864 + 0.9425959091 + 0.9151416559 + 0.8884957882 + 0.8626201845
            = <strong>4.5797071872</strong> (more precisely 4.579707187194534).
        </p>

        <p>
            The present value of a constant annual benefit is therefore:
        </p>

        <p>
            Present value of benefits = annual benefit × 4.5797071872.
        </p>

        <p>
            For Scenario S5 the annual WTP based benefit is 1,741.2 million rupees. Multiplying
            by the present value factor gives:
        </p>

        <p>
            1,741.2 × 4.5797071872 = <strong>7,974.2 million rupees</strong> (approximately).

        <h3>6. Programme costs for 50 trainees and 10 cohorts</h3>

        <p>
            The cost attribute in the DCE is the direct programme cost per trainee per month
            measured in thousands of rupees. For each scenario the STEPS tool converts this into
            annual programme costs for the chosen cohort size and number of cohorts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The direct training cost per month for one cohort is the monthly cost per trainee
            multiplied by the number of trainees in the cohort. For Scenario S5 this gives:
        </p>

        <p>
            Monthly cost per trainee = 75,000 rupees.<br>
            Trainees per cohort = 50.<br>
            Monthly direct cost per cohort = 75,000 × 50 = <strong>3,750,000 rupees</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            With 10 cohorts the monthly direct training cost is:
        </p>

        <p>
            3,750,000 × 10 = <strong>37,500,000 rupees</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Multiplying by 12 gives the annual direct cost:
        </p>

        <p>
            37,500,000 × 12 = <strong>450,000,000 rupees</strong> (450 million rupees per year).
        </p>

        <p>
            Applying the same five year present value factor of 4.5797071872 gives the five year
            present value of direct costs:
        </p>

        <p>
            450 × 4.5797071872 = <strong>2,060.9 million rupees</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The STEPS tool can also include opportunity costs of trainee time. Users enter the monthly
            opportunity cost per trainee in the configuration tab. The tool then adds this to the
            direct programme cost using exactly the same structure as above
            (opportunity cost per trainee per month × trainees per cohort × number of cohorts × 12 months,
            then multiplied by the present value factor).

        <h3>7. Benefit cost ratio for Scenario S5</h3>

        <p>
            For Scenario S5, bringing together the present value of benefits and the present value
            of direct programme costs for 10 cohorts of 50 trainees gives:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Present value of WTP based benefits: 7,974.2 million rupees.</li>
            <li>Present value of direct programme costs: 2,060.9 million rupees.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The benefit cost ratio (BCR) is the ratio of these two figures:
        </p>

        <p>
            BCR = 7,974.2 ÷ 2,060.9 ≈ <strong>3.87</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In other words, under the assumptions used in the STEPS tool, each rupee of direct
            programme cost in Scenario S5 is associated with about 3.9 rupees of stakeholder
            willingness to pay for the programme benefits over the five year horizon, when
            training 10 cohorts of 50 trainees each.

            The table below summarises the results for the seven example scenarios provided, using
            the same modelling approach as described above. All scenarios assume 50 trainees per cohort,
            10 cohorts, a five year time horizon and a 3 percent discount rate. Costs refer to direct
            training costs only. Benefits are based on WTP from the DCE.

        <p>
            All seven scenarios have high predicted endorsement levels (around 80 percent or more) and
            benefit cost ratios comfortably above one, indicating that stakeholders are willing to pay
            several times the direct training cost of the programmes. Among these examples S3 has the
            largest benefit cost ratio, followed closely by S6 and S5, illustrating how blended delivery,
            moderate or high mentoring, and strong outbreak response capacity combine to generate high
            perceived value at relatively modest cost levels.
